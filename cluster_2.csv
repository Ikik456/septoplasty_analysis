9,My ENT wants to do a harsh turbinate reduction method with scissors and I want a safer method because the turbinates are delicate. Should I go to plastic surgeon instead?

52,"Literature says that septal perforation repair has a questionable success rate. Yet, some providers that claim to be able to repair septal perforations with high success rate are unclear on what timeframe they are using to measure. Is 30 days long enough to be sure the mucosa has fully healed and the chances of long-term stability are high, or is that too short given that the graft material has probably not fully fused yet? Is 12 months too long to expect a provider to use as a measurement?",2
54,I have been in discussion with two plastic surgeons who specialize in septal perforation repair about getting mine fixed. One prefers to use alloderm as a graft - which obviously reduces donor site morbidity concerns since there is no graft donation from the patient. But can alloderm change and adapt with the body over time if the nose changes shape as one ages? I only want to have this procedure done once. I would think patient donor cartilage would perform better long-term.,2

	A month ago I had septoplasty, turbinate reduction and polyp removal.&nbsp;An abscess developed&nbsp;with painful swelling&nbsp;at the left&nbsp;nostril&#39;s base.&nbsp;The doc thinks I reacted badly to&nbsp;the sutures running through the septum&nbsp;(right&nbsp;- left nostril). He tried a drain which fell out after 4 or 5 hours.&nbsp;Then he removed the original stitching and replaced it with new, wire-like stitches which he says are absorbable. Each time required multiple local anesthetic injections to the upper lip and base of the nose which, frankly, were worse than the actual surgery. He prescribed a course of an augmented amoxicillin. I just took my last one this morning and am scheduled to see him later today. My fear is, now that I&#39;ve exhausted the antibiotic, the infection -&nbsp;which has subsided but not completely disappeared -&nbsp;will come roaring back. At this time, I&#39;m still pusy&nbsp;at both&nbsp;sides of the septum - especially the left as the thing seems to be draining from right to left.&nbsp;Furthermore, &nbsp;I&nbsp; don&#39;t think I can take yet another&nbsp;set of injections into my upper&nbsp;lip.&nbsp;I was in a quasi-state of shock after the last episode. My question: How long does something&nbsp; like this normally take to clear up?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
