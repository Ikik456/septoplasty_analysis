1,"I had a septoplasty 3 years ago, it was done using my own cartilage from the nose and it was placed on the tip of the nose. And I have been seeing redness every now and then, but it doesnt cause any pain nor breathing problem, it just gets red and it comes and go. Will it be related to the surgery? I have seen a surgeon here but I was told the nose was fine and was given antibiotics. It improved but it comes and go.",3
17,I deviated my septum when I was 10. It was never fixed. I'm now 45 and have noticed changes in the shape of my nose over time. Its wider and there is a blood vessel or something visible through the skin following the crooked septum.,3
19,"I understand that during septoplasty, the bent or deviated part of the cartilage is removed, and a straight piece is put back into the lining. My question is, how does that piece of cartilage the was put back remain stable? will it fuse with existing cartilage over time? Will i be able bend my squish my nose and it feels perfectly normal? Is my nose weaker now due to a piece of cartilage being permanently removed?",3
22,"Hi, I had my septoplacty done 6 months ago. I can breath very well but my nose is still extremely swollen (Or maybe not). My nose used to be very thin before it got crooked. But now my nose is bigger than ever! I get comments on it 24/7. The doctors say its swelling. But swelling? For 6 months? And most of the swelling should have been gone til now, even if there still is swelling its probably not much. Im very frustrated and need answers",3
27,Its been almost a year since my surgery and I have noticed that my nose does not look the same as it did before. The tip of my nose has changed and the cartilage right above it seems to have dipped in. I am very unhappy since I was adamant about not changing my nose and the physician insisted that the surgery would not change the outward appearance of my nose.,3
102,"About a year ago, I had an accident at the gym. A weighted medicine ball hit the left side of my nose, causing a deviated septum and slight crookedness. I've attached before and after pics. My question: Can septoplasty alone restore my nose to how it used to be, or is septorhinoplasty my only option? Just to be clear, I'm very happy with the shape of my nose before the injury, and I'm not looking for a nose job, but I'm curious in your expert opinion. Thanks.",3
120,"Hello, there are so many issues with my nose, a hump at the bridge, the nostrils and a droopy crooked tip. What are my options ?",3
156,"In the way that, the cartilage that was removed be put back where it was taken from? (From another source) Obviously Im not asking for more deviation. Just wondering what could be done to replace the structures lost with these procedures. Mine involved the strict removal of bone and cartilage and research has proven that this can cause a revision to become even more complicated. I am petrified at the amount that was just straight taken out of my nose without putting it back in readjusted.",3
169,I had a closed nasal fracture reduction and a septoplasty done 2 weeks ago. Had the nose cast on for 5 days and then it was removed in office. This evening some cat hair tickled my nose and when I went to brush it away I tapped my nose and felt my septum shift. It popped to the side and then I panicked and tapped the other side so it would pop back to the center. Now I'm afraid to touch it and I'm worried I messed it up? It looks OK in the mirror and doesn't hurt.,3
174,"Before my surgery I could smell. Straight after my surgery I could also smell a bit despite being congested from the operation. However a week after the operation, at the same time as starting on Flixonase to reduce the inflammation, my smell / taste went completely and has not returned. Is this normal?",3
180,I had a Septoplasty with open reduction nasal fracture and spreader grafts as well as turbinate modification due to a deviated septum accident happened last year. 10 days after surgery Ive noticed the bridge of my nose is much wider and larger in general. Even tho Septoplasty is done internally would this still be due to swelling? Will it eventually thin down or are those due to spreader grafts that were placed? 2 Pictures each before breaking/after break/ after surgery included,3
185,"I just had my septoplasty 3 months back. Before surgery, my nose looked straight and both of my nostrils would appear even if I slightly tilt my head up but now they are not visible enough am I having retracted columella? when I smile my nose looks, even more, pointing downward also sometimes in the morning, my nose tip will become bigger and bulbous should I worry about this all Are there any exercise to straighten and sharp my nose I am hesitated to go for another surgery Thank you",3
193,"Its two weeks op now and Ive noticed since getting the splints removed that my septum is still deviated completely blocking my right nostril as it was before. Worried i wasted my time and pretty fustrated about it. It cant be swelling because I can feel the curve and clearly can see it. I dont have easy contact with my surgeon as it was done publicly, so have come here for any assistance. Thanks",3
195,"Hello,i had septoplasty surgery two month ago and a week after the cast was removed from my nose some bump appeared on the supratip on my nose and its still there two month after, it looks even worse to me me. Could you please tell me is this swelling or some deformity?",3
207,I had closed septoplasty 8 months ago mainly because I had a slight deviation and I hated my nose from the side which had a big hump. It was clear I did not want to change from the front. I am really starting to think that I disfigured myself. I liked my face from the front and now I really hate it. I was very swollen and had big bruises after the surgery so I did react a lot to the procedure but the before and after seem way too far from each other now to get any better.,3
225,"
	On the fifth day after my septoplasty i was half asleep and wasn;t thinking and blew my nose pretty hard. I was instructed not to blow my nose for a couple weeks. Did i do damage to my septoplasty?
",3
257,"I had my septorhinoplasty on 16th Dec,2018 and my cast was removed on 1st Jan, 2019. After the surgery I had unexplained high fever for a week. Now after over a month, I can see there is a scar, a bump on my septum and also my nose has become crooked and bigger than before. Should I be concerned or keep my patience?",3
265,"I had septoplasty, turbinate reduction, and nasal valve collapse repair using septal cartilage grafts and Latera implants 12 weeks ago. Initially, nose appearance was the same. I use a full face mask for the CPAP, which puts pressure across the bridge of my nose. I now have a visible, palpable, hard, diagonal bony ridge under the thin skin on one side of the upper third of my nose and possibly an indentation in skin under it. The surgeon at last checkup said it is ok. Should I be concerned?",3
270,"About 3 years ago I got one for a deviated septum and my nose looks different, the natural beauty of the nose gone. It is wider in the bridge, shorter at the tip almost like they chopped off a piece of the tip. So tip is also less defined as is the bridge. It's almost as if they removed cartilage and flesh from the tip but they didn't do a good job because it looks like there was work done instead of it looking natural like I asked. Should this have changed the nose?",3
272,"I recently had a septoplasty done and was informed he had stitched splints in to my nose, now I was trying to remove the blood clots in my one nostril and it got stuck so Im no longer sure if it was a blood clot or the splint that was stitched in to my nose. It was thick and black like the rest of my clots, but was the only one to get stuck. Is there a possibility Ive moved the splint?",3
307,When my splints came off i felt bit happier with my nose but after 3 months now my nose look same as my pre-op am so much worried my doctors told me that your nose got no swelling and this is your result am totally broken,3
337,"I have had a septoplasty the 7th August and it was a success,&nbsp;today I've been in the pool and i hit my nose with a mask,&nbsp;my nose is swelling and red and the nose bridge is bigger so I&nbsp;applied some ice. I'm so worried cause it can stay permanent?&nbsp;Please give me an advice on what I&nbsp;have to do as soon as possible. Thank you very much",3
340,Iv had a septoplasty done on the Tuesday 21st but it's now the 25th and I know its not a long time to be thinking of it being fully heal but I still have the same narrow nasel passageway that i had before the surgery. Is it normal or did it not work,3
341,"I got hit in the nose with a soccer ball when I was young, but forgot about it because I didnt feel pain . Then recently I saw one of my nostrils was higher and I had deviated suptum so I got the surgery done to fix my deviated septum, but I dont even know if he fixed it right. Before the surgery my cartilage between my two nostril was uneven, and after it was uneven too. Also, now my one nostril&nbsp;is way up and looks crooked . He said its swollen and it has been 1 month now. Give me advice.",3
355,"currently had septoplasty last week, and today I was applying the saline solution inside of my nose when one side of the bottle nose/cap slipped and hit the inside of my nose, the middle part that divides with nostrils . I have an appointment next week but should I worry of any damage since.it was hit from inside the nose ?",3
366,"I had a septoplasty and tip work done about 14 months ago. Everything looked great until November, when a small pea size lump was felt and seen (a bit) in the tip of nose. I had many steroid injections, to no avail. Last week, my surgeon made a small incision inside the nostril to cut out scar tissue. Everything was smooth until a week later. I can now feel and see (a little) the lump. He ordered a MRI which found nothing in the cartilage department. Thoughts?",3
368,"An ENT performed a Septoplasty and Inferior Turbinate Reducation on me 6 days ago. My nostrils were asymmetrical pre-surgery due to a deviated septum. Now after the procedure, they are even more asymmetrical. One of the nurses called to check on me the next day and told me it was because there was more work done to one side than the other, so there is just more swelling. However, now most of my swelling has gone down and I just dont see how the nostril will just change shape.",3
377,"I am 3 weeks post-op, and I have developed very pronounced swelling on the interior of my nostrils near the tip. It is pretty tender, but so is the tip of my nose. The lump itself is quite hard. In the past Piercings have formed keloids, so I asked my surgeon if this is a possibility. He said that keloids dont form on mucus membranes and to just keep using aquaphor to keep the the skin moist. I spent so much money to improve air flow and I am concerned that the lump is reducing it again.",3
385,"I had septoplasty 16 days ago and my nose is very unattractive, without any feminine aspect, huge, no curve, the tip is over projected, I touch bone all over where the hump was removed (so there is no swelling there to expect it to lower and the shape to change) and overall I am very disappointed. I know that I need time to see the final result but I see other people's pictures one week after the surgery and their nose, although stil swollen, has already a shape that fits their face.",3
394,I had my follow up appointment 3 days ago and my surgeon said that incision was a little infected. He prescribed me antibiotic ointment. I had taken a look into my nose and seen a slight yellowish white snot looking coat over the incision. I have been applying the ointment but not covering the whole incision. I had checked it out today and the same thing was over the incision but there was a lot more. Is this part of the healing process or should I be concerned of the infection getting worse?,3
403,"Two weeks ago I had a septorhinoplasty. I recently discovered a bump in my left nostril. It is about a q-tip length up my nostril and it is blocking about half my nostril. It is on the inside, against my septum. What could this be? I saw my surgeon a couple of days ago and he said that it was a scab and that my nose was dry and swollen, but this does not at all appear to be a scab. Could it be displaced cartilage? Could my septum just be deviated in a new place? Could it be an internal stitch?",3
404,I recently like abt a week ago got and SEPTOPLASTY &amp; TURBINATE SURGERY and I have swelling and feel as if my nose is not mine when will the swelling go and will it make my nose bigger after the operation and and will the facial look remains with swollen nose and will I get the same looks back or will my nose remain this big itself,3
408,"I had an open septorhynoplasty and turbonite reduction 9 days ago. I didnt want any change in my nose shape or look besides straightening it. Im particularly worried about the wideness through the bridge of my nose and the size of the tip. Based on my photos, do you think the look is only because of swelling or did I just ruin my face?",3
412,"I use to have quite a high radix giving the impression of a very long nose, my surgeon lowered it to make it look more natural. From some angles it looks perfect but from others I think my nose looks a little scooped, or that the nose and forehead is continuous and I have no radix. I have tried to capture this the best I can in the photographs. Im not complaining but I would however like to understand a little more about whats been done and if my observations are correct. Thank you.",3
413,"Hello, I'm currently post operation newly 6 weeks, my nose still swelling, my left nostril is still half blocked, it seems crocked.. Is this normal? Is the swelling making it harder to breath or should I check my doc? Thank you",3
426,"I had septoplasty about a month ago. It was for a mild deviated septum. I could not visually see it. About 2 weeks after my surgery my septum suddenly looked very deviated and the hole in which the air passes is through is barely larger than a slit. It is normal for this to happen, is it swelling and will it go away or does this mean my septum got worse and I will need surgery again?",3
428,"I have just had septorhinoplasty 1 week ago, I had my cast off yesterday, the nose looks very straight. However I have noticed that there is a slight lump on the left side of the top of the bridge of my nose, I don't know if it is bone that has moved of weather it is hard swelling? Just wondering what is the chances of the bridge bone moving to cause a lump on the side!?",3
430,"Hello. I just had an open Septoplasty 4 days ago where my septum was straightened, turbinates were shaved down and a spreader graft was put in to improve my breathing. I realize it's still VERY early to be making any judgement on what my nose will look like ultimately, but I feel like my nostrils are so flared and wide they almost look deformed now. I didn't think the appearance of my nose was going to change too drastically, so seeing this is just a little worrying for me.",3
432,I've recently had a septoplasty and now I have a prominent dorsal hump on my nose. The septoplasty was on the NHS for my breathing issues but now the dorsal hump is really really making me insecure and I cannot possibly afford or want a rhinoplasty to fix an issue which shouldn't have even occured. What can I possibly do for this because it is making me very anxious and insecure. Is it possible that the hump will go down or will it have to be removed? Otherwise my nose is now straighter than before.,3
439,"I had septolasty, sinus and turbinate surgery. ENT said he could even out my dorsal hump at same time. After swelling went down over a year ago, I have several dents on the bridge of my nose and the tip seems to have dropped. My nose looks huge when I smile. I'm got engaged and am looking to do something about my nose without breaking the bank??? I've attached a picture of what my nosecond looks like and what I'd like it to be. Thanks",3
450,"hi. I got a septo-rhinoplasty 15 days ago and i still have swelling and bruising. My nostrils were not even since i got out of the surgery, but i was told its because of swelling but now the cartilage of my left nostril is caving upwards when i breathe and looking somehow broken compared to the left one. my surgeon told me he did not touch my nostrils. i am extremely concerned and i really need to know if this is a result of swelling. please help and thank you in advance.",3
451,"
	Can working out in the gym, particularly doing kick ups with the ball affect the nose after septoplasty? I think my cartilage shifted and got deviated after I was doing that. It is already almost 2 yrs since surgery. When does a nose fully heal ? What can cause it to shift back ? I had a same problem 5 months after surgery, now it happened again. My nose is very stuffy, it feels like something has shifted.
",3
453,"I am well aware that most residual swelling can take up to 1yr to resolve and I was prepared for that, however, I was NOT prepared for this extreme asymmetry in my nostrils. My surgeon is adamant that it is all due to uneven swelling, but it is just very hard to believe & I feel like I look like a freak. I also have a small lump at the incision site. Can anyone confirm that this could definitely just be due to swelling???",3
459,I had a septoplasty 2 weeks ago and my nose looks exactly the same it was before surgery if not bigger is this normal. I also still see a bump on my bridge that I was supposed to be remove according to my surgeon. Will that go down anytime soon?,3
472,"I had a rhinoseptoplasty as well as a turbinate reduction. They used a closed technique, went in through my nostrils and reduced dorsal hump while in there. My surgeon said there might be a chance my nose may appear thinner than before. Since the surgery my nasal bones have been far wider than usual and one side of my nose is far more swollen than the other. Im worried my nose isnt healing correctly and will be wider than before. I know it takes a while to heal but I'm still concerned.",3
476,"4 weeks from septorhino and my nose was straight in the profile until the last couple days when I noticed a dip between the tip and bone area. Cant see much in pictures but Im concerned it may be the start of a saddle nose. My Dr. has me doing massages for 30 minutes a day! Im wondering if that weakened the cartilage in the areait FEELS weak. Also, I used to have a very large, Mediterranean nose. Should I stop the massages? My surgeon says KEEP massaging and he doesnt see a dip at all.",3
483,"Hello ~&nbsp;Need professional opinion as to why it could have changed, what went wrong, can it be fixed, costs, and risks and % of success. - Nose looks more bent / crooked - Nose tip does not align with philtrum anymore - My ear cartilage was harvested - From a cosmetic perspective, how was my nose before surgery and how is it afterwards? - I also have a slight dent in my bridge now (not smooth/flat)",3
488,"I asked more of a slope, shorter nostrils and an uplifted tip. I feel like everything I asked for I didnt get, I now have a straight nose, an improved but droopy tip and uneven nostrils. My surgeon said my nostrils are not uneven.My question is, can the droopy tip, uneven nostrils and slope be done in a revision? Ive also read to remove scar tissue the surgeon might have to make the nose bigger, is this true? Thank you in advance for your help.",3
494,"I had open septorhinoplasty 6 weeks ago. And after my swelling is being subside realized some lighter skin color lines where my nasal bones meets the middle third of my nose. I feel like my nasal bones are wide,, and its not edema because i pressed on them with my index finger and counted down 100 after that they went just a little bit inwards still wide. And this made me questioning the lines i saw and if i am prone to having inverted v deformity in the future.",3
501,I had a septoplasty and when the surgeon was pulling the bandages off he left a cut/dent on the bridge on my nose. How can I fix this? I have tried scaraway silicone gel but it doesnt seem to me working.,3
516,A week after my surgery I met with my surgeon and he said my swollen/painful left turbinate was normal after surgery. But it is almost two months now and it is still the same. Is this normal and do I just need to give it more time?,3
520," I recently had a septoplasty about a month ago. My nose was very dry and extremely clotted, the doctor removed these clots about 4 times since my surgery but I guess I have developed a septal perforation because of the surgery. My nose continues to clot severely and it is very very dry, I know that the perforation was developed due to removing the clots, I could feel it ripping away at my septum, but I am just wondering if my nose will stop clotting and moisten up, thanks",3
544,I had major septal reconstruction and rhinoplasty to remove the hump on my nose 4 months ago. My surgeon said I was VERY deviated and that my septum was completely to one side and a 5/200 case. My nose is as hard as a rock now. My smile has not shown much improvement in the last two months. He says this is due to stiffness and NOT because of nerve/muscle cutting and that this will clear in 1 yr. Is what he is saying true? I'm very depressed because I loved my smile.,3
559,"Two days after surgery i noticed one of the splinters inside my nose was crooked, i went to see the doctor again 6 days after surgery so he could remove the splinters, I told him my splinter was crooked and he said it was fine, its been 2 weeks exactly today since i had surgery and i still feel my nose clogged, its that normal, how long does it take for me to feel the difference?",3
565,"The picture on the left was taken 8 months after the revised septoplasty. My doctor claims the shape of my nose has not changed. The nose is in fact, shorter and with an unattractive dorsal hump The tip of my nose is still numb, and my lips seem to have changed shape too. Is this been seen by anyone before? What is the best approach for me to have this corrected? This is my 3rd procedure on my nose",3
568,"I could still breath and it didnt hurt for very long. The side I hit it on looks more bigger, but my nose still appears straight. Also, could hitting it do slight damage and not redeviate the nose, or would the only damage possible be redeviating it?",3
569,Day 2 of post-op I cleaned my nose with hydrogen peroxide and a Q-tip. I cleaned around the rim of the nose inside and out very lightly. 30 minutes later my nose started to bleed in little drops running out of my nose. I was unable to get the bleeding to stop overnight although it slowed down significantly. I woke up this morning to a crust filled nose and a good amount of pressure towards the bridge of my nose. Did I cause a preferation ???,3
573,"Hi, I got an open septo rhinoplasty at the end of December 2017. It's been 4 weeks and I've been pretty unhappy with the results. First things off my nostrils are incredibly asymmetric, and there's a pretty noticeable bump where the graft was placed. Looking at my face straight on, the shaft of the nose itself is pretty asymmetric too... I'm hoping that this is still early on and I should be patient, but by now i should have a pretty good sign of how the final result should end up. Thoughts?",3
576,"Hello, I had my nose done on 28th of December 2017, nearly 3 weeks ago, even with my cast on I noticed differency on my nostrils, I thought that could be because of the cast or splints in my nose, but we got them off and it's still different, even from the front you can see how uneven it is.My doctor says it will get better as the swelling goes down,but I am not sure about it. I would like to know, does it look like something caused by swelling?will it get better at least a bit?or total failure?",3
579,I had a septorhinoplasty just under 3 weeks ago with the cast removed after 7 days. With every day that goes by I can see a bump forming on my bridge which is hard as bone. The rhinoplasty was to straighten my profile (before picture also attached). Im really nervous that the hard bone on my bridge will remain and my profile will no longer be straight. Im really hoping that it reduces (and I know I have to be patient) but it just seems to be getting more pronounced with each day.,3
582,"I was wondering why the dorsal hump on my nose looks larger in profile. I did not have this fixed, could it be related to the grafts and swelling in the lower part of my nose from the grafts. I am 3 weeks post surgery",3
591,"I had a septoplasty performed 17 days ago with turbinate reduction. I have noticed as of 10 days ago that I have a bump that has developed on the bridge of my nose that was not there prior to the surgery. My surgeon told me that sometimes the septum settles down after surgery, and the bump was most likely always there but not visible. I was under the impression that no cosmetic changes happened after septoplasty. Should I get a second opinion? Could my septum be compromised?",3
604,"4 weeks ago open septorhinoplasty. (tip refined, hump removed, nose/septum straightened as it was deviated).... it doesnt look masculine and strong. It looos flat and then sloping. I seem to have lost my nasion or it is very low now. I have a continued forehead/low radix or nasion. Like avatar with no dip or a very low dip. I think it looks awful.

732,My nose looks bigger and wide from the bottom than before my septoplasty surgery.i was told that my bone was also cracked and it was quite difficult for the doctor to cut the extra bone and give it a good position ..now its been 4 month of post septoplasty i have better breathing and straight nose but my nostrils are wider than before and looks big..will it go down,3
739,"I had a septoplasty 6 days ago to correct a deviated septum and I had a small bump on the bridge of my nose taken down. Before the surgery, the doctor had assured me that my nose shape would not change ( I already liked my nose before) and that she was only correcting the inside. But now, my nose looks extremely longer than before and more turned up. The tip especially looks huge and the nostrils as well. Is this just swelling? Will I get my old nose back in a couple weeks?",3
747,Its been a month for the septoplasty with nasal reconstruction. I have a round face and my nose after surgery is highly raised and looks tilted from above. NoSe is very sharp also my eyes look sunken. I had a costal cartilage insertion. When will I get real shape of my nose. Is swelling still there? How many months to get real shape of my nose?,3
769,"I had a septoplasty with nasal frame work correction. The doctor got my deviated septum corrected, placed a costal cartilage on my depressed nose and reduced the tip. It was a 3 hour surgery. This is what my nose now looks like. Big and ugly. The pic is 8 days post op. I am not happy wid my nose job. What can I do??",3
787,"I broke my nose and had to get septoplasty but also opted for a revision for my very slight dorsal hump. I made it clear to my doctor that other than making it straight again and fixing the bump, I didn't want anything else about my appearance to change. Seeing my nose post op, I notice the bridge of my nose is significantly skinnier than before. Was making my bridge skinnier a necessary outcome of septoplasty/revision of dorsal hump? Or did my surgeon make this adjustment on his own volition?",3
788,"I had a septorhinoplasty (+ osteotomies) about 10 weeks ago. By about 6 weeks I started to see a very prominent bump on my bridge and an indentation at the supratip break. The bump feels very hard, like bone. I've had 2 visits with my PS since the surgery and he thinks it is swelling. I appreciate all feedback and advice, as I am very worried about my current outcome. Also, I think it is worth mentioning that I did NOT have an indentation at the supratip break before my surgery. Many Thanks!",3
789,It is now two months since my septorhinoplasty and swelling has reduced in all areas below the bridge of my nose however it actually looks and feels like my bone is sticking out before dramatically reducing back down on the cartilage area. Will the swelling go down and should I be concerned by this as I am not due to see my doctor again for another month?,3
791,"I know it takes a year + to see final results, but it's been 8 months and my nose looks like this since 4 months post op. I had one side shaved down a little to match the other and nothing else touched. I had one steroid injection done as well. I still see that there is swelling but the side that has been shaved is the one sagging. I addressed my concerns to my surgeon but he said we'll see in 3 months. Is this normal or does it look like I'll need revision done later on? Thank you.",3
798,Hi.I have internal nasal valve collapse and septum deviation.My doctor said he will do septoplasty and use graft for collapse.but i dont know which the graft is.He said that my nose tip will be more straight .i thought this could be a spreader graft.Does the graft change my nose? Because i dont like my nose tip so much,3
808,"Once my cast and tape were put on, one nostril apprearwd to be trapped under it, holding the nostril up at a different angle/shape. Now that the cast is off, there's little dent in the tip. It's one month post op- the tip is still pretty lifted in my opinion- will this dent and unevenness from the bandages settle out as swelling goes down?",3
821,I had some minor septoplasty done and rasping of the bridge done a few days ago. The swelling is more evident on the bridge up to between the eyebrows. Anyone any recomendations to help speed recovery,3
826,I had a septum alignment on my nose two weeks ago. My pallet is number and I woke up from surgery with a protruding bump near the bridge of my nose that has not gone away. I asked the surgeon and he has walked right around my concern with a claim that he was no where near that part of my nose. When I said that I did not have that lump before the surgery he claims that that is the equivalency of operating on my wrist and me complaining my elbow is too big. I'm nervous that I am permanently disfigured.,3
857,"I had a septoplasy done 4 days ago, Does my nose look like it has been operated on properly ? I had the op done on the NHS in the uk it seem like I have gone thought all of the upheaval of the op and they haven't done it properly I asked the surgeon if he remove much bone from the nasal crest and he looked at me with a gormless expression",3
862,"It's hard to tell from some of the pictures, but it looks like the upper lip can possibly be lifted slightly with a septoplasty or rhinoplasty? What is your experience with this?",3
868,My nose still has the exact same deviation as before surgery. I will be on camera soon and i need to have this fixed as soon as possible. Its not uneven swelling. My nose is still crooked. I dont think my surgeron even tried to correct it to be honest not even a tiny difference its the same !!!! Only thing i can say he did improve was my chubby tip. When can i go to a different surgeon and have my nose straightened ... Is 4 months enough ?,3
872,"I had open septoplasmy 2 weeks ago which required lowering my bridge and some work done on my tip. The inside of my nostrils however have become very red in addition to ooze coming out of a blackened spot near the tip. Is it infected and if so, what should I do? If not, what should I do to alleviate the discolorations. I appreciate your advice in advance.",3
873,"I had the inside of my nose put straight, I think the name of procedure is a septoplasty. Now I can see little holes on the inside of my nose from where the stitches may not have healed properly, I have what seems to be a giant boogie in my nose, when I was rinsing my nose out this morning it became loose but it seems to still be attached to a stitch. I have tried to take photos of it but I am unable to, I'm really concerned I had my operation two weeks ago. what should i do?",3
877,"I had open Septoplasty and turbinate reduction surgery, cast and splints for 10 days after. Since I didn't have a cosmetic rhinoplasty and everything was internal, I was told it's just fine to wear glasses. However, when I wear my glasses it causes indentations and what feels like lumps about where the nasal bones and maxilla would meet. It's been over a week since cast came off. Is this just swelling, or could the bones have changed at even though that area wasn't touched during surgery?",3
878,I had septoplasy surgery yesterday morning to correct a deviated septum. Today I noticed I could not lift my upper lip to smile but it is not swollen. I also noticed my two front teeth are very sore and hurt almost as much as my nose. I'm sure this is common but when I research it online I can not find anything related to it. Is this normal since surgery was only 30 hours ago or should I mention it when I attend my post surgery appointment to remove the stints?,3
884,I had a deviated septum corrected and my nose straightened in 2015. I loved my nose initially after my cast was removed but slowly over the year as it healed it began to change. My bridge seemed to collapse and my nostrils retracted. My tip has become puffy and my columella is very visible now. A surgeon has confirmed I have an inverted v derformity. I'm wondering if I'm also developing Polly beak?,3
888,"I had a nose incident 8 years ago and I haven't been able to breathe clearly out of my nose since. For various reasons, I am considering getting a septoplasty. That said, I would also prefer if my nose tip was flatter and my nostrils were more circular (see photos). I can achieve this look while mildly applying pressure on my nose tip (I also breathe better when doing this), but of course it doesn't stay. Can the tip be flattened and the nostrils be circularized like that permanently by surgery?",3
894,It has been 1 week since i have had a septorhinoplasty and turbinate surgery. I have found the pain in my nose very tolerable however now i am experiencing more pain on the bridge of my nose and at one side of my septum. I thought that the swelling in my tissues were cushioning my nose and therefore it was not as painful at the beginning. I have not changed the amount of pain mediation i have been taken and am worried as surely the pain should be subsiding rather than getting worse? Many Thanks,3
903,"I'm 3 months post open septoplasty and also had my hump straightened and tip lifted. I have noticed that there is no changes taking place in the tip of my nose. I don't enjoy having any photos taken as the tip is so round and just doesn't look natural, it's getting me down. I understand over time swelling will subside but will the shape of the tip change and not appear like there is a hard ball in there?",3
918,"In the last 6 months, a hard, protruding bump has formed on my nose tip . An ENT examined it and said the tissue had shifted because of a septoplasty from 5+ years ago. However, he did not actually touch it, and I am somewhat skeptical of this diagnosis because the bump is nearly as hard as bone, and the tissue in that area did not used to be hard at all . Furthermore, other than the bump itself, the rest of my nose is exactly the same as it was before. What else could this bump be? Thank you!",3
926,He also used a suction machine to clean out my nose. Can this machine cause my deviated septum to go back the way it was before the procedure. I looked tonight and the one side looks smaller inside and feels congested. Is this normal maybe some swelling caused after sucking? Should I be worried??,3
932,"I was hit in the nose 2 days ago, it bled right away and hurt very bad. there's no bruising but the inside of my nose and my septum inside my nose is still swollen and my nose hurts to touch. Also i have had a stuffy nose ever since, but i'm not sure if this is the cause or if i just caught a cold",3
936,"Hello, I did septo/rhinoplasty about 2 weeks ago. My cast was removed about a week after. The bridge of my nose was smooth and straight, however when I visited my surgeon a week later, he began to touch the nose and the tip to make sure everything was the way it was supposed to be but later that day I noticed a slight bump appear! I'm not sure if it's because he touched/pinched the bridge while checking which caused swelling or if my bump is coming back!!!!",3
942,"
	I am ONE year post primary septo-rhinoplasty. Pre-surgery, I had an almost perfect profile and straight nose &amp; even nostrils. What I asked for was correction of breathing problem and narrower nose. My nose is much bigger than before, crooked and noticeably shifted to the left, tip is hard and bulbous and nostrils uneven. I also have chronic pain in the bridge and tip areas. I consulted 3 different surgeons, all say different things. My own surgeon says he can&#39;t help further. Any Suggestions?

948,"I'm 8 weeks post op after my septoplasty. I had a choncha bulsa removed, turbinate reduction, and my nose broken to move towards the center. My nose was crooked beforehand because of the growth. Is this how it will look in 5 months? Doesn't look like much changed with my nose and it was suppose to have been recentered. Still looks crooked though. Is that swelling? That is the side where the growth was. Thoughts?",3
951,"I had septorhinoplasty 17 months ago. It resulted in a dorsal hump I DIDNT have prior. My Dr. waited 8 months after my septorhinoplasty to rasp it down. He said this would solve the problem. I am now 8 and a half months post op from the rasping and I still have a small dorsal hump. I'm starting to give up hope that it will still go down, and Im very upset about this. Am I overreacting? Is there still a chance it will still resolve itself?",3
968,"At 3 months P.O. &amp; am losing hope with what my dr says is normal which by my pic's you can clearly see isn't. I had a Septoplasy and tip only ear cart grafts placed for a deviated septum/lower collapse. Dr told me she put fascia over my septum as a last min. decision at end of surgery. I had a straight nose prior to surgery. Feel something has been wrong from the 3rd day when my splint was on. I was in agony/ then to see my nose at splint removal, I was in shock. Constant bridge pain still.",3
982,"I had a septoplasty, bilateral turbinate reduction and sinus surgery (fluid removed on one side and cysts removed in the other). Immediately after changing my first bandage, my family noticed the tip of my nose was turned up, resembling a pig snout to some degree. The doctor said the appearance of my nose would not change prior to having the surgery, but the tip has drawn up. Could this be due to swelling and/or plastic splints that are still inserted? Will my nose return back to normal??",3
984,"and everything was good, but still was a little congested so I bought a little machine used to suck out mucus it kinda looks like a little gun. After I used it the side where the surgery was done got very swollen. It's been 3 days and the septum wall still looks swollen could it be that it redeviated or is it just inflammation I'm very worried.",3
985,My nose looks different after the septoplasty. I knows it's superficial but I really wasn't looking for any change and to my understanding the surgery should be internal and doesn't affect the external. Any idea what may have happened? Can you see the difference and will it go back to normal? Looks like there is more of a dip before the tip or pointier/rounder tip? What would cause this? I'm 4 weeks out of surgery.,3
996,"Had septoplasty 5 days ago. Got hit in the nose yesterday by my daughters head. One side was bleeding for about 30 minutes. What are the possible causes for bleeding, beside the obvious possibility of a new fracture? Have visited my surgeon, he told me that he can't know or do much as long as the swelling goes down.",3
1006,"I'm 5 weeks post-op. Had an inverted V, deviated septum &amp; bone spur repaired. Dr placed ear fascia as a last min decision at the end of my surg. By day3 outer splint felt like a vice, I was in AGONY, told my dr at splint removel how bad &amp; she said really. As splint came off I was devistaed, still am. There was a HUGE dorsal hump (straight nose prior to surg). Bridge has not stopped hurting I've told the dr from day 1, dr says its swelling. Could it be fractured? Would a scan be helpful?",3

1034,I'm having a very tiny piece of cartilage removed from my (upper) septum as a revision. My septo-rhinoplasty 5 years ago took 2 years for a full recovery so now I'm worried about post-operative swelling. Is it typical for very minor revisions to require long for reduced swelling?,3

I've also noticed, when changing the gauze under my nose, that the tip of my nose that used to turn downward, seems to be more straight across. I have my splints removed tomorrow. Will this help with the swelling and the change to the shape of the lower part of my nose? I'm not complaining about the change, just shocked by it.",3

It appeared after 5 weeks. it also feels hard - thoughts?",3
1049,My nose looks shorter and the shape has changed post septoplasty. The bridge is swollen and so has the tip. I have had this procedure twice before but the doctors previously took a closed approach. My nose nose looks different to the previous post operative shape. In particular the tip has rotated and so I have a piggy nose.,3
1065,"Hiiii. Im extremely worried. I know this may seem like a ludicrous worry, but i had a septoplasty 7 months ago and am 100% satisfied with the results, it offered me a 80% improvement in the shape of my nose &amp; deviation. however, Im worried however that because cartilege retains memory, my nose may go back to its original deviation. My surgeon says 7 months on, its likely it wouldn't..but i still need a second opinion for my own peace of mind. Is my nose going to go back to its original shape?",3
1110,I recently had a septoplasty procedure due to w deviated septum. I also had a bump on my nose which the surgeon said he would file down meaning there would no longer be a bump.

How long does it take for swelling to go down?,3

However, while My nose is still straight, my nostrils appear to be different now and the septum is sticking out from where it had been straightened.

My appointment is in 3 days with my surgeon, is there anything I should do?",3

Unfortunately since week 2 the bridge of nose has continued to grow and I have no slope now. My surgeon said to tape &amp; massage daily to breakdown scar tissue. I'm massaging lighter than he showed me as my bridge hurts when I Massage. Is this massage pain normal &amp; is it likely slope will return?,3
1164,"I had a septoplasty 6 months ago after an injury (closed septoplasty, no rhinoplasty). In the past week I found what I thought was a pimple or abscess in the most forward part of my nose. I began picking at it trying to pop it and am afraid it was a piece of a suture (I think they call it tip-defining suture). I cannot say if my nose has changed shape. Are permanent sutures used in septoplasty and if so, has enough time elapsed that scar tissue will support the structure of my nose?",3
1166,I had septo-rhinoplasty done 18mnths ago but since then my nose has re-deviated (not as bad as it was but enough to make it noticable) Is revision septoplasty something that actually works the second time around or is there something the surgeon does differently the second time.,3

Why does one regenerate and the other does not? I am assuming that there are more stem cells in the perichondrium of the nasal septum than in the lateral cartilages?

1482,"I had a S shaped deviation that started all the way from the bony septum & a large nasal spur. So after the surgery I was told I might develop a perforation. So i was cautious but when i looked at my nose with a flashlight, I could see a smallhole in the septum. When I asked doctor about it he said it was because of the spur, they had to remove a lot of cartilage, so perforation was there. He said it will close up. Will it ever heal on its own, or is my doctor not being entirely honest with me??",3
1497,"I was sucker punched a few years back. After responding in kind ( I'm not proud of it but I hurt him worse than he hurt me), I went to the bathroom and immediately realized my nose was broken. It wasn't bleeding but the bridge of my nose was at least a quarter inch off to my right. I reset it, but ever since then I wake up congested and when I blow my nose the tissue is full of blood. Recommended course of action?",3
1501,About 4 months ago I had a septoplasty to help my breathing but it had no noticeable results. I recently back to my surgeon and he informed that my septum in still deviated right under the bridge of my nose and can't be straightened because my nose would lose structural support down the line. The only thing he said that can be done is a rhinoplasty with grafts to widen the nasal passages. Is there any way to straighten my septum even though the deviation is right on the bridge of my nose?,3
1505,I had septoplasty / rhinoplasty and turbinate reduction about 10 days ago as I like the way my profile looks but dislike the front the tip looks bulbous and big and I can see parenthesis I understand I'm still swollen but is doesn't look natural. Any suggestions that is will change or was it just a bad nose job?,3
1507,"My doctor says no, but my brother had one done and his surgeon broke his nose. Is there a difference as to why one surgeon may want to break the nose and the other doesn't? I've also read that the cartilage can take the original form later on. Would breaking the nose help prevent this?",3
1515,I had septoplasty almost 4 years ago - I still have swelling - here are recent photos. If I massage the areas the swelling shrinks but returns. Would Kenalog injections help with this?

1517,"Hi, I recently had a septoplasty and blew my nose extremely carefully (like little mini nose breaths) on day four of recovery and didn't think anything of it however today, day six, i noticed that what I had thought to be a huge booger is actually what I believe to be a stent in my nose. So basically my question is is it possible for my septum to 'revert' back to what it was pre-surgery because the stint was moved? Also, I've had no bleeding issues in case that helps",3
1519,I had a Septoplasty last December. The results were ok but the tip of my nose is still crooked and looks very deviated when looking up the nostrils. What is my best plan of action going forward?

1531,I just had a septoplasty and FESS done exactly a week ago from today and i've noticed that my nose looks bigger than what it was previously before the surgery. It is not as swollen in comparison to a few days ago but i feel like it has just plateaued and that i'm stuck with this swollen big nose; I'm starting to feel kind a little OCD about it. Is this normal?,3
1535,My surgery failed about a month after I had it done. Now my nose is worse than it was before I had the surgery. I have no idea how it collapsed so fast after surgery but I had the impression it was going to fail because my outer skin was really stretched around my septum putting a lot of pressure on it. This made things uncomfortable especially when I would smile and laugh. I was wondering if this could have been responsible for the septoplasty failure.,3
1536,I had septoplasty about two years ago and it made my nose look even more asymmetrical than it previously was. My nostrils are very different in size and shape and it's the only thing I notice when I look in the mirror. It makes me uncomfortable in my skin.,3
1543,So it's been two weeks since my septoplasty. My nostrils are still very asymmetrical and swollen. When will it return to normal? What can I do to speed up the process? I'm so congested I feel it when I blink my eyes. Is this normal??,3
1548,"My cast was removed 2 weeks after my surgery because he told me that the longer, the straighter the nose. He then gave me this tape thing that I was told to apply for a month post-op daily on my nose. It's been about 10 days since I'm applying this tape and he told me it's supposed to restrict further swelling? I had an event coming up so I asked him if it's ok t remove it for a day, he said it was fine but when i did remove it, after some hrs i noticed my nostrils went in different directions?",3
1551,"PS and I agreed a 'subtle' effect was desired, reducing the hump and tip slightly. After surgery, my PS said that he had needed to perform a septoplasty due to unforeseen need. I had my cast off today- my nose looks flat & small, emphasised by the dip in the middle of my nose, which I think might be a saddle nose deformity? If this is the case, will the saddle nose improve with healing alone i.e with drop in tip? healing of cartilage? reduction in swelling- could swelling cause this look?",3

I then had an infracture 3 weeks ago where the bump was found to be the roof of my nose so no rasping was needed. I am now worried about the asymmetry of my bridge. The bump has gone but now the other side of my nose looks to form a hump. Could this be swelling or does it look to be permanent?",3

I can breathe so well, but my hump is still there, and it's bigger. My ENT said he smoothed it down and the bump looked gone during surgery. Could it be swollen just enough to look the same as it used to? Should I worry about scar tissue? Is there anything I can do to get the swelling down?

	I am a guy in my 20. and I had septoplasty in my 16. I just found that septoplasty in puberty may affect the growth of the septal cartilage and most people's septal cartilage are curved in different degrees.

The problem is I have found that the anterior inferior boarder of my nasal cartilage was removed, which support the nasal tips(according to what google tells me). So would it change?

	I had a septo-rhinoplasty one year ago. The very tip of my nose is still quite squishy - it's not hard like it is in other areas where I definitely don't have any more swelling. Is this a sign there's some residual swelling in the tip? Also, the skin at my bridge hasn't completed contracted yet, and is pretty loose. I'm only 22, and I did not have loose skin on my bridge before the surgery. Will it eventually contract?

	I was hit in the nose by a soccer ball 6 months after septorhinoplasty. My surgeon examined me 5 weeks ago, but didn't seem too concerned. I however have noticed slight changes to the cartilage, including a slight dint, a very slight droop in the tip, my nose moves like rubber and my breathing out of the left side is limited. He said come back in 6 weeks if there was still swelling. A CT scan showed a deviated septum, but he said no one's was completely straight. Am I too concerned?

	2 years ago I had a septoplasty to fix a severely broken nose. Few months later I noticed growths on my nose that the surgeon shaved off. More growths appeared 6 months later, much more noticeable. They were shaved off and my surgeon put a steroid on to stop more growth. 8 months later after that surgery my nose begins looking caved in and uneven, and increasingly so. Surgeon tried injecting kenalog, but now my nose looks deformed! I'm feeling desperate, what are my options?

	3 months post septo/rhino. Now when I smile, there's a crease under my nose &amp; bulges under both nostrils. My tip is VERY swollen, beaky &amp; firm; my PS put in a tip graft that extends into my columella &amp; sutured my tip cartilages. I used to love my smile but am now embarrassed because the line extends all the way across my mouth, like a mustache. My PS wasn't concerned and said we tend to focus on the face too much after a rhinoplasty. I was hoping he'd say swelling. :( Any hopes for my smile?

	Hi Experts pics below I had an open Rhinoplasty Septoplasty and turbinate reduction that took 3 hours. I have heard that 80 percent is gone in a month and I realize the swelling takes a year or more to to go away but I was wondering about the tip it still seems hard and swollen, please refer to the pictures of my before and after Thank you for your time!! 1.

	6 months after rhinoplasty/septoplasty surgery, I had a soccer ball kicked into my nose. There was some blood and swelling, but I don't think there is major damage. The cartilage however, doesn't feel quite right, it feels like it has moved in the tip and mid portion of my nose. My GP is sending me for a scan, but won't refer me back to my surgeon if the scan shows everything as normal due to having to justify this action to the insurers. What should I do if I feel everything is not right?

	I had a septoplasty nearly 3 years ago just a few days after I turned 18, at the time the appearance of my nose barely changed, but as the years went by, my nose started pinching until now it is very noticeable, when I went into this surgery I thought that the appearance of my nose would not change, does this have anything to do with the septoplasty? can this be corrected?

	I had alar base reduction and a septoplasty done- The septo was 4 both breathing and cosmetic reasons as the nose was twisting slightly to the side. Now I&#39;d also like to have the bridge of my nose project forward less so that my nose looks smaller in profile view. There are doctors that will only do primaries and will not do revisions. So do a septo and slight alar base reduction count as a &quot;primary rhinoplasty&quot;?

	About five years ago, my nose started to feel &#39;crooked.&#39; It doesn&#39;t really look crooked- this isn&#39;t a cosmetic question. Over time, it&#39;s gotten work. It&#39;s (I think) the septum- what is in between the two nostrils at the bottom of the nose. It veers over to the left and I constantly feel as if it needs to be pushed to the right. It&#39;s not painful but I can feel it- it feels like it&#39;s pushing leftward on something it shouldn&#39;t be. It&#39;s really frustrating me and I&#39;m constantly &#39;twitching&#39; my nose.

	Its been 5 months since I received a septoplasty and small bump reduction (rhino) from a broken nose injury. Its now 5 months after surgery &amp; nose looks about 2x larger than it did before. My nostrils have lost their definition, giving my nose a pushed in bulbous look. I&#39;ve been reading that it takes about 6mo-1 year to see full results, but my nose has seems to stopped swelling. Is this normal? What should my next course of action be? Thanks

	Hi, I&#39;m not a native English speaker, so please forgive my grammar mistakes. I&#39;ve developed a septal deviation in recent years and my cartilages have also gotten bigger. As a result, there&#39;s a small hump on my nose. I generally like the shape my nose, but from some angles, it looks really bad to me. I&#39;m thinking of having septoplasty and cartilage reduction. So, does reducing the cartilages automatically remove my hump as well? if not, what should I ask for? I don&#39;t feel ready for rino yet.

2575,"I have what feels like a continuous lump running along both sides of my septum, near the bridge of my nose but nowehere near the incision. On the opposite side, the new obstruction is now worse than my original deviation. It feels like something was pushed up after Septoplasty and hasn't come down again. My nose was very tightly packed after surgery.  I still get tingling, an itchy tip, and my nose aches sometimes so I can't wear glasses. I'm hoping all this just means it's healing nicely.",3
2577,"I developed a bump on my nose after Septoplasty and Rhinoplasty, which is hard and basicaly a lifted bone. My surgeon said he wants me to correct it as it is quite obvious; although not too large in size. He will go in and shave it down in 15 minutes and I will need no splint. This doctor is very optimistic. So, I worry that this is not accurate. Is it possible to jus go in and have the hump shaved  down in such a little amount of time, and just leave with a bandage? How long will my recovery be? Last time it took me 8 months to get back to looking &quot;myself.&quot;",3

	About two and a half months ago I had septoplasty surgery along with a little bit of rhinoplasty. Nothing was done to the tip of my nose, he was just supposed to straighten it and refine it but it still looks crooked. I am not satisfied with the job done by my surgeon and wish to get a rhinoplasty revision. How long should I have to wait before undergoing another surgery?

2589,"I had a nose job, a septoplasty, with my nose narrowed and the tip refined. While the nose appears to be smaller, the tip is ball-like, and from the side view, it juts out. Could this be because of the general swelling of the nose? How much smaller could the &quot;ball&quot; look once the swelling has gone down?",3
2590,"I had a septoplasty two weeks ago, as the cartilage on my tip before operation was pushing to one side and needed correcting. My front profile has improved a little so I'm pleased with that, but my side profile still looks big and long. My tip looks too large for my bridge and is very upturned, which makes it stick out, so I'm disapointed with the results at the moment. Is this normal? I&nbsp;also have slight insertions that are visible in natural light at both sides of my bridge. Will these go?",3

	I had a septorhinoplasty done 4 months ago, and I know I will need a revision of the septum. The first surgery I had my septum straighten along with spreader grafts put in. Also the tip of my nose was brought in. During the healing process my septum noticeable bowed to one side, making it very difficult to breath on that side. I have heard you are supposed to wait a year before the revision, but since I know for sure the septum is bowed (and it&#39;s not swelling issues), do I have to wait a fill yr

	Septoplasty on Tuesday... Is this how my nose is healing or is this just swelling? I had my deviated septum fixed on Tuesday and it is now Friday, the swelling is expected, but the thing that worries me is the angle it is now at from the front and the side profile is now gone. Is this just because of the swelling or is this how it will heal? From the front view I now look like a &quot;pig&quot; with my nostrils open and showing, and the side is flat and angles up. I told the dr i wanted to look the same and he said ok, I wasn&#39;t told it would change at all, and I am freaking out. Thanks.

2611,"I had Septoplasty to straighten my nose because it was very crooked, especially at the top. The doctor told me I could remove my cast ten days after the surgery. When I took the cast off, my nose was very straight and it was narrow at the top and I was pleased. The next day when I woke up, I looked in the mirror and noticed that my nose had swelled up at the top and the bone also looked slightly crooked at the top but not as bad as it was before surgery. It seemed the bone was going back towards the way it was. It's  been four days and it is still like this. Is this normal or is my nose going to stay slightly crooked?",3
2621,"I have posted a few questions on this site regarding septoplasty and dorsal augmentation. I will be getting both in junction with turbinate reduction. I was wondering, what are some of the side effects from this type of surgery? Will I develop unwanted lumps on the bridge of my nose as a result of scar tissue, and if so, what can be done to solve this problem? After my surgery I will be giving a review of the outcome of the surgery. I am also on small amount of corticosterioids for my lupus. Will that affect the healing process? I have consent of my rhematologist and PCP.",3
2625,"I had a Septorhinoplasty to correct a broken nose. The surgeon should have made my nose thinner, but I think it looks the same and it's been over a year.  I had a Rhinoplasty after a year following that to remove the hump and refine the tip. It's been nearly 12 weeks. Now, my columella is droopy, the tip is drooping down (making it look long), the nose looks wider, and the tip looks huge. And he's left me with a scar that is very, very visible.

2626,"I broke my nose about four years ago 8 months ago. I had a Septo-Rhinoplasty for it. However, the results were not what I wanted. It has made my nose fatter and the problem is still there, the bridge of my nose is still deviated, not to mention the lower part of my nose has also become worse. I used to love my nose; is it possible to have it fixed? If yes, what is the procedure called? I live in UK. Could anyone recommend me a good surgeon in my area? I would appreciate any help that I can get.  Thanks!",3
