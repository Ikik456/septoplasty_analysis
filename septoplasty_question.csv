	I had septo/turbinate/rhino on Tues. It's now Thurs. The swelling and pain has been unbearable for the past 2 days. I feel like my nose is being crushed under the cast and although I am keeping my nostrils clean my nasal passage is narrowed by half due to the swelling. I had to return to the hospital the morning after surgery due to severe bleeding under the tip in which a dressing was applied to stop the bleeding. The top corners of my eyes have enveloped the cast.

	My brother has never had nosebleeds as a child. He is nineteen and recently he has experienced frequent, heavy nosebleeds. Today a large piece of cartilage came out of his nose during one of these bleeds. He is on isotrenanoin, although he claims the nosebleeds began before this. He also has very low blood circulation. He has never smoked or taken drugs. I researched possible reasons for this and it seems that in some (rare) cases such nosebleeds can be a symptom of a tumour. Is this possible?

	I was hit in the nose by a soccer ball 6 months after septorhinoplasty. My surgeon examined me 5 weeks ago, but didn't seem too concerned. I however have noticed slight changes to the cartilage, including a slight dint, a very slight droop in the tip, my nose moves like rubber and my breathing out of the left side is limited. He said come back in 6 weeks if there was still swelling. A CT scan showed a deviated septum, but he said no one's was completely straight. Am I too concerned?

	2 years ago I had a septoplasty to fix a severely broken nose. Few months later I noticed growths on my nose that the surgeon shaved off. More growths appeared 6 months later, much more noticeable. They were shaved off and my surgeon put a steroid on to stop more growth. 8 months later after that surgery my nose begins looking caved in and uneven, and increasingly so. Surgeon tried injecting kenalog, but now my nose looks deformed! I'm feeling desperate, what are my options?

My tip is VERY swollen, beaky &amp; firm; my PS put in a tip graft that extends into my columella &amp; sutured my tip cartilages. I used to love my smile but am now embarrassed because the line extends all the way across my mouth, like a mustache. My PS wasn't concerned and said we tend to focus on the face too much after a rhinoplasty. I was hoping he'd say swelling. :( Any hopes for my smile?

	I have a deviated septum. My ENT recommends a septoplasty operation in conjunction with nasal valve reconstruction (warranted because I have thin nostrils). My ENT says that the nasal valve reconstruction will change the appearance of my nose slightly. The thing is, I like my nose and do not wish to alter its outward appearance, particularly if it would mean a wider nose. In your experience, how drastically does a functional, bilateral nasal valve reconstruction procedure widen the nose? thanks!

The incisions inside my nose came apart and are loose, so I have these gashes in my nose that I have to be careful with so they won't get irritated. The incisions fell apart most likely because the cartilage between the nostrils was crooked, and my doctor never fixed it. Now, it's even worse and visible too.&nbsp;I also wanted the size of the nose reduced a little, but he didnt even touch the bone. Can these even be fixed since they're healed this way?&nbsp;What do I do, as I don't trust this surgeon anymore?

	I had my deviated septum repaired approx 19 months ago but it did not solve my problem with not being able to breath with the right side of my nose. At night I hold the skin back near my check in order to breathe or if not I snore and wake up with a sore throat. I have a bump just inside my right side of my nose and I can see that my nasal passageway is almost completely closed just by looking. Looking for surgeon recommendations for Central Florida and what is the term for this surgery?

	Six months ago my wife had surgery for a deviated septum and rhinoplasty. The rhinoplasty was to reduce the length of her nose, reduce nose tip, and to remove a bump. She explained to her doctor concern on the bend her nose takes and the asymmetrical nostrils. He continues to insist that this is something that can still self-correct as swelling reduces, but we are skeptical. I&#39;d appreciate opinions on the underlying problem and what kind of revision will be necessary.

	A month ago I had septoplasty, turbinate reduction and polyp removal.&nbsp;An abscess developed&nbsp;with painful swelling&nbsp;at the left&nbsp;nostril&#39;s base.&nbsp;The doc thinks I reacted badly to&nbsp;the sutures running through the septum&nbsp;(right&nbsp;- left nostril). He tried a drain which fell out after 4 or 5 hours.&nbsp;Then he removed the original stitching and replaced it with new, wire-like stitches which he says are absorbable. Each time required multiple local anesthetic injections to the upper lip and base of the nose which, frankly, were worse than the actual surgery. He prescribed a course of an augmented amoxicillin. I just took my last one this morning and am scheduled to see him later today. My fear is, now that I&#39;ve exhausted the antibiotic, the infection -&nbsp;which has subsided but not completely disappeared -&nbsp;will come roaring back.

	I had an open septo-rhinoplasty 5 motnhs ago and I like the result so far. The problem is that while I was cleaning my nose (2 months post op) with a q-tip I went too deep and there was some blood on the q-tip. After that my nose was swollen inside and out and I experienced breathing problems ( only breathe from one nostril, sometimes right or left). Is this from the swelling or is it a septal hematoma or any other problem? Before this happened my breathing was great from both nostrils.

	I had a septorhinoplasty done 4 months ago, and I know I will need a revision of the septum. The first surgery I had my septum straighten along with spreader grafts put in. Also the tip of my nose was brought in. During the healing process my septum noticeable bowed to one side, making it very difficult to breath on that side. I have heard you are supposed to wait a year before the revision, but since I know for sure the septum is bowed (and it&#39;s not swelling issues), do I have to wait a fill yr

	I had my septoplasty surgery almost 2 months ago, and so far I still haven't feel good about the result. Although I sleep better but the air flow is still not smooth going into my sinus. I can always feel there's swelling or burning on the side that was worked on. I do heard a lot of people saying the procedure takes max. 6 months to see effect. Meanwhile my doctor said the airflow looked perfect and nothing else can be done. Does it really have to wait that long to see effect? I m so lost...Need help please!
