0,"Can a septoplasty fix upper lip asymmetry? The septum is deviated, the tip is off to the side, and the nostrils are at different heights. Therefore, the upper lip is also asymmetric, and its crooked/tilted so that the lip line is diagonal. So, will a septoplasty fix this issue, or is more needed to permanently fix the issue at hand?",1
3,"I have a very weird congenitally crooked nose. Ive felt different. I want to get it fixed, as well as a decent breathing problem I have, but having a bulbous tip and a sizeable bump, I am wondering if my nose can be made smaller at the tip, bump lessened, and still improve breathing with the septoplasty. IIs this possible? There is a congenitally collapsed side of my nose where i could see a spreader graft being used, but mostly I think a reduction in size would suit my face best. Thank you!",1
11,Would septoplasty fix my deviation? And would open or closed technique be more suitable,1
13,"I have a deviated septum which makes my nose look quite crooked. It's genetic &amp; got worse throughout puberty. I was advised by an ENT to get a septoplasty (alongside turbinate reduction &amp; sinus surgery). I can never get any air into my left nostril, unless I do the Cottle Maneuver. Because of this, I'm concerned that straightening the septum isn't going to fix my breathing issues, and that a rhinoplasty would be needed to properly straighten my nose to accommodate for a straighter septum.",1
15,I'm bothered by the cartilage protruding to my left nostril giving a very asymmetrical appearance to my nostril. I have no significant breathing or sinus issues and although my nose (septum) is deviated I'm not bothered by it and I dont want to change its appearance. I just would like to harmonize the look of the nostrils. What are my options?,1
16,"Hello. I had a septorhinoplasty four years ago. Initially, my breathing improved and I liked how my nose looked. In the past two years, Ive noticed my septum has become extremely deviated again and as a result, my nose is no longer as straight as I would like. It seems as though Im the only one that notices these changes and after speaking to a surgeon about it, he confirmed that the septum was the reason the nose looked crooked. Could a septoplasty help to slightly straighten my nose again?",1
20,Wondering if septoplasty would improve breathing out of my right nostril or if my turbinates are too hypertrophic to make a difference? Or maybe no bad enough to make a difference at all?,1
23,"Ive been wanting to get my nose fixed for awhile now as it has caused me headaches along with an almost always stuffy nose, which makes it hard to sleep at night. I have state insurance and I was wondering how much of that would cover the cost of a septoplasty?",1
24,I am not sure if I have a deviated septum or just a crooked nose. I do have more trouble breathing out of one nostril more than the other. Either way would my nose be a good candidate for a septoplasty?,1
25,"Hi, I have a raised bump/nub at the base of my septum that I would like to get rid of. I've noticed that other people's septum goes down into their philtrum and looks a lot more seamless where's mine just stays there and looks like a bump. I have a long philtrum but I'm 18 so I'm trying to avoid getting a lip lift right now in fear of scarring and it messing up my lip shape and smile. I'm planning on getting a closed nose job in the future but idk if that will resolve my bump on my septum or not.",1
26,"Hello, I am an 18 year old female and would like to know if septoplasty is the right surgery for my nose?

28,"Hi, I am hoping you can give me some advice. I have a deviated septum and have been recommended to have a septoplasty with turbinates and tonsils removed at the same time. My question is this - can I have my turbinates and tonsils out in a second operation 2 months after my septoplasty? and for closed surgery, can the ent shave some of my nasal hump off, or would this be considered cosmetic surgery? Many thanks",1
36,"Hello. I visited a rhinoplasty surgeon years ago and he also told me that I have a deviated septum. It causes me a lot of issues, including not being able to breathe properly. I also suffer from nasal polyps. By looking at the picture of my nose, I would just like to know and get confirmation if this is the case? Thank you",1
37,"I've seen other CT scans of deviated septum's and I don't think mine looks right but my current dr says it's not deviated, and I don't need it fixed. I have breathing issues and am having other treatments done but if this needs to be fixed I like to do it at the same time. Should I get a second opinion or a different dr? (Ignore the red circle that's for something else, lol)",1
38,Is it normal for my nose to be so crooked? I did some research and some of the results that I pulled up stated that it could be a deviated septum and that in severe cases septoplasty could solve the problem. Is this a minor case? Could septoplasty fix it? Am I overreacting?,1
39,Ihave an operation booked for an open septoplasty and I asked the surgeon if open septoplastyhe is going to perform would also visually straighten my nose and he said it wouldn't change the appearance of my nose.Is it possible he is trying to get me to pay extra for a septo rhino even though the open septo operation would straighten it anyways ?Some surgeons say it straightens it some say it doesn't without rhinoplasty.My insurance covers the procedure but not the rhino portion.What's the truth?,1
44,"I have read a lot of differing opinions on septoplasty. But Im pretty sure my nose is only crooked due to my deviated septum? I have an appointment with an ENT specialist this month and I know he can only give me th3 answers Im looking for after determining all the factors! I will be getting the surgery even if theres no changes on the outside, but Im hoping It will also help my insecurity of my nose! What are the chances it will also straighten out my nose?",1
45,I wad told by a specialised doctor that I have a c-shaped&nbsp;deviated septum. Does&nbsp;my deviated nose looks noticeable? I found out my nose looks asymmetrical in photos. What kind of surgery can fix this problem? Septoplasty ? Alar reduction? Is it worth to correct this issue. Thank you for the advice.,1
51,"I'm getting septoplasty and turbinate reduction surgery soon. I was just thinking that a non-medically necessary surgery, like the reduction or straightening of my dorsal hump could be done at the same time. If so, my insurance will pay for the septoplasty and turbinate surgery, but can I simply pay for the difference between that and the dorsal hump reduction (rhinoplasty, I guess)? In other words, will I save a bunch of money doing both at the same time?",1
53,"I want to get the filler as Im approaching the year mark and I want to build on my previous fill. The surgery would be about a month later. Nothing external is being done on my nose, and theres no filler in or around the nose. Just making sure theres nothing Im missing as I can wait on the filler if absolutely necessary.",1
55,"Hi, I've had an MRI and noticed what I believe to be a deviated septum. For years I have been complaining of a restricted airflow in one of my nostrils and difficulty breathing at night, but no took this seriously and I was told it's common. Does this image show a deviated septum? And if it does is it helpful to take this image to a rhinoplasty surgeon at my consultation or do they not need it? And does my deviation look like it can be resolved?&nbsp;Thanks!",1
56,"I think I may have a deviated septum. I have plenty of issues with my nose from nasal dripping to sinus headaches. Can you tell from the following pictures? I am afraid of the outcome, I am in my mid 40s and dont want to look like a different person, but my issues are getting worse with age.",1
57,"Hi, I've been wanting my nose done for a while but do not want anything too drastic as I am scared it will not suit my face.

60,"I went to ENT and they scheduled me for a septoplasty for next month. I am aware that septoplasty cannot change the external appearance of nose, unless certain circumstances. I am wondering if it can fix the crookedness of my nose that leans to the right as my nasal deviation is also to the right. I have attached two photos. I would prefer to send pictures privately if need be.",1
63,My nose was injured and in turn gave me a deviated septum with breathing issues but also makes my nose curve over and has become somewhat lengthened on one side. I am wondering if the curve and lengthening in the photo will be corrected with septoplasty alone?,1
68,"Hello, Im just wondering if youve had a deviated septum for many years that if it can affect the inferior turbinates? Because as far as I know Im having an obstruction in my nose and I believe its due to my crooked septum/nose. Im also skeptical of getting a turbinate reduction due to ens even though its a rare case there is&nbsp;still a chance one can develop the disorder.. so will a septorhinoplasty be enough to help my breathing issues?",1
69,"I've had a deviated septum from birth and so do my other two brothers. I've always had allergies and massive nasal congestion, let's just say I blow my nose every day at least 20 times a day regardless if I have a cold.

76,"I was looking at my op report and although it is labeled as septoplasty, the procedure mirrors that of SMR. Among other numerous red flags, I was under the impression that the breathing part of surgery would be straightening of the septum. That is how it was described to me. Not removal. And certainly not JUST removal with no reconstruction using the excised cartilage. Can you please explain the differences so I can figure out what happened to me? SMR seems to prove detrimental to revision.",1
77,"Hi Doctors! I had revision septo-rhinoplasty almost two years ago, but my nose is more crooked now than it was previously. I tried having filler done to hide how crooked it is, but I feel like Im also not getting the best airflow. Is the appearance of my crooked nose due to a deviated septum?",1

Thank you!",1
86,"I had a deviated septum done on May 22, 2018. I was told by my surgeon that I would still have difficulty breathing due to allergies. I thought that getting the surgery it would correct this. Did she just lie because it wasn't done properly? She was disappointed in herself because she didn't remove more of the bulbous tip. Should I see another specialist for a second consultation?. I just want to breathe better.",1
90,"I have a deviated septum (caudal septum). I know a septoplasty doesnt change the nose appearance but I feel like my case could be an exception. I got different opinions from doctors and Im looking for a straight answer. Some doctors say septoplasty would fix, others say I need alarplasty.",1

The septo surgery is far less risky than the septorhino correct? Just looking for some guidance in making this huge decision.",1
100,"Considering getting a Septoplasty soon. Just want to know if my nose would straighten with just that or if I would need another procedure on top of that?

Just discovered That I could have had a septorhinoplasty free of charge during the acute stage (2 years) The surgeon at the time did not mention this to me.

107,"I believe my septum is deviated. My nose is very sideways and my nostrils are uneven. It is uncomfortable and breathing is a bit annoyingly I wanted to know where I should go to be diagnosed/how likely insurance is to cover it. I understand cosmetic rhinoplasties are not covered by insurance but are offered at a discount since they will be in there anyway and have already used anesthesia for the septoplasty. When I sniff, one nostril goes in/touches the bridge while the other doesn't.",1
112,"As seen by two specialist I have a unique perforated septum. I have an anterior perforated septum, not at the septal cartilage but at the membrane between the septum and columella where there is no cartilage.

After other tx, I'm considering septoplasty. Could this: 1. Shorten my columella 2. Straighten nose. If I'm getting surgery I'd like to fix these aesthetics also & would love advice on what to ask for. Thanks!",1
117,"I have a severely deviated septum for which my ENT recommended a septoplasty. However, he mentioned that because I had a rhinoplasty (9 years ago) I could risk dropping my tip.

Thank you",1
118,Two years ago I got a rhinoplasty where my tip was reconstructed. I like the shape of my nose but it leans to the left and my nostrils are uneven due to a deviated septum.

I'm understanding how very important it is to get this right the first time, as I do NOT want to have or need any revision surgeries. That's my very worst nightmare.

At my follow up, my doctor suggested spreader grafts. There would be no out of pocket expenses, but the the surgery would be likely performed by a resident. The attending has over a decade of experience in head and neck surgery. Is it unreasonable to be defensive about a resident performing my revision surgery?",1

After doing some research, a few surgeons that having a septoplasty can make a subsequent rhinoplasty more difficult because it removes the excess septal cartilage that is used for reconstruction in a rhinoplasty.

348,So recently I have been told that my right nostril is being blocked by my septum and that may have led to me mouth breathing for a while now. I also have an overbite and some crowding on the lower teeth. I I just want to know if that has affected my face any and if anything can be done to improve my situation.,1
352,"Primary concern with surgery what can happen. I have 100% medical coverage If my Septum was more deviated I would be fine doing both at once, but I think that since the main issue appears to be with the turbinates it doesn't make sense to fix just a slight deviated septum.",1
370,I have difficulty at night breathing one side closed off. No crusting or issues with infection from the hole. I have surgery years ago for the deviated septum and broke my nose again.,1
371,"My nose appears to be more crooked in the lower portion, especially when I smile. After several consultations, Im leaning towards my ENT doing a [closed] septoplasty, endoscopic sinus surgery and turbinate reduction. Note: I had [open] septorhinoplasty ~15 years ago. This time around, Im mostly concerned about my breathing than the aesthetics, but thought I read somewhere that a septoplasty can also help straighten your nose if the deviation is in the lower half? Please let me know. Thanks",1

419,"Additionally, I've always gotten nose drip and found it difficult to breath properly specifically through one side of my nose. I've gone to the ENT and a specialist but they've only given me sprays or burned vessels but they never seemed to work as I continue to have these symptoms to the point where I am just tired.

However, it looks like I underwent a rhinoplasty or at least a tip-plasty. I know that my nose is swollen and it will take time, but my concern that my nose is pointing upwards. I have splints, are the causing this upward change, or did surgeon lift my nose? My mouth also seems to open slightly.",1
441,One nostril is higher than the other nostril would they make it so the lower nostril is higher as well? Would this result in the drooping tip not being as pronounced? Also would a septoplasty make my nose wider?,1

My ENT that will be performing the septoplasty advised that not my entire septum can be straightened, and this confuses me to what I see online.

474,I recently saw an ENT who recommended I see a plastic surgeon for septoplasty (he labeled by deviation as severe) because removal of septum tissue requires addition of support structures to prevent nose from collapsing. I was primarily looking to improve my breathing/sinus issues but it seems I am getting into cosmetic territory with requirement of support structures.

499,"I had a septoplasty and turbinate procedure done by an ENT specialist yesterday to correct breathing difficulties. My nose now appears wider in the bottom section and looks crooked at the tip. Is this due to swelling or a defect in the procedure? I was told there would be no external changes to my appearance as there was no rhinoplasty. How long should I wait to assess the results? If it remains crooked, what does a revision surgery entail - or will I need a rhinoplasty? Thanks for your advice.",1

588,My nose is very crooked and I have trouble breathing when I sleep. It is also a bit big in comparison to my chin. Will septoplasty help straighten my entire nose or just nostrils?

I know insurance will cover part of the procedure if there are medical reasons for it. How would I go about finding out if I have a deviated septum/getting insurance to cover it?",1
929,"I'm 17, and my nose was broken when I got hit in the face several times during childhood. It  resulted in deviation of septum, fractured nose, and breathing problems. I have Americhoice by United Healthcare Insurance without out of network benefits. Rhinoplasty wouldn't be covered, but what about the Septoplasty? Does anyone know a doctor who could perform both Rhinoplasty and have the Septoplasty covered? &nbsp;In line with this, would it be a good idea to have two surgeons perform&nbsp;Rhinoplasty and Septoplasty&nbsp;(covered) separately, or just one ENT surgeon?&nbsp;Some mentioned it would be affordable.",1
935,"When I was 17, I underwent septoplasty and turbinoplasty to correct my deviated septum and reduce my turbinates. I'm now 20 and I have been advised that my mid-lower septum is once again deviated or collapsed and that my turbinates could further be reduced. My specialist advises that I may need to undergo revision septoplasty and revision turbinoplasty but hasn't really explained the risks or their likelihood of occuring. I'm particularly worried about perforation of the septum and valve collapse",1

938,"Hello. I am a 21 yr old student and 3 years ago I had rhino/septoplasty to correct my nose after having broken it when I was 11. My nose is still fairly crooked, but my doctor said that this was the most that they could do at the time. I feel as though it is just marginally straighter as compared to before the surgery. Would it be worth it to get another surgery, or would this be a waste of money? Also, I had a fracture septum that was repaired. Is this truly as good as it can get for me?",1
941,"First, since I was a child I have had insecurities about my nose. My dorsal hump and tip seem in my eyes to be to large for my face. I am curious what work on my nose you would recommend if any; and if it would drastically increase a pleasant appearance. Second, I have sinus issues and a diminished air flow to my left nostril. If I have a deviated septum would my insurance cover the suregery?.",1

947,I NEED a narrower nose and have been looking into rhinoplasty but when stumbling upon the price range I realized it could end up being a problem especially if I need revision. I recently discovered if you have a deviated septum insurance will offer to help as long as this is confirmed by a doctor and before wasting my time with an appointment for dosapointment I was wondering if it had the appearance of it. I have had constant nasal issues with nose bleeds and bulbous size I would LOVE help!,1

My nose is crooked from previous trauma and I would like to straighten my nose as well as make is smaller in width and shorter.

979,"I just left an appointment at Mass ENT. The Dr. said that my nose is the worst deviated she seemed in years. (Almost 100 percent blockage) I am going through with surgery no matter what in three weeks time. She stated to me that no cosmetic changes will be made. However, is there any chance the bump of my nose, size of nostrils, or crookedness of my nose will be changed at all? I'm hoping for something to be changed for the better. What changes can I expect with a nose so deviated ?",1
986,"Hi, I was wondering if from my photo you can tell whether it looks like I have a deviated septum or not? I have difficulty breathing through my right nostril (the nostril on the left in the photo) and It's always bothered me. You can also see I definitely have a crooked nose and I was wondering if that would be due to a deviated septum? If I were to have Septoplasty, would this reduce the crookedness of my nose as well as improve breathing difficulties?",1

Therefore i thought those injections were an option i.e with acid hialuronic however after researching i realized that septoplasty would correct the breathing (air flow) problem.

I am not quite ready to have the cosmetic issues (crooked nose and droopy tip) addressed just yet, but I am thinking about getting my breathing issues addressed soon.

1097,I have a severely deviated septum that I plan to get corrected soon. I've spoken to an ENT who recommended septoplasty and 'turbinate reduction.' But trying to decide if adding some cosmetic work is worthwhile. I have a somewhat 'hanging columella' (just based on what I've read on this site). How hard is that to change?

1197,Good day I broke my nose 7 years ago but didnt get it checked. I decided to see an ENT for difficulty breathing. He says a septoplasty is enough to get a straight and even nose and breathe well too but if I happen to go under the knife I would like to address my whole nose and get a good job done. Is he right? Should I get a septo (according to him it would improve the aesthetics too) or go for a rhino to get rid of that hump and different side views? Would it be a difficult surgery?Thx a lot,1

My goal is for improvement not making a bigger problem? What do you think? Thanks for the help!,1
1439,"For a few years now (but to a higher degree over the past few months) I have been suffering from breathing problems which mainly originate from the nose (breathing rhythm feels distorted, often feels obstructed, and have become overly aware of breathing) have noticed that one nostril is very asymmetrical from the other, as shown in the pictures i have attached. Have read about what is called a deviated septum and was just wondering if this is applicable to me and what is the most effective treatment?",1
1452,"My doc said I had a deviated septum and my turbinates needed a reduction to improve breathing. The septoplasty is finished and I feel well, however I'm wondering if the cocaine I did 3 years back resulted in my enlarged turbinates/septum to be damaged to the point that it was affecting my breathing. Even though i stopped for 3 years, i was getting frequent sinus infections/crusting. I didn't remember having these issues before. Was the main damage from the drug or my nose structure? Environment?",1

I will be having my turbinates reduced along with the septoplasty. Also, what is the most effective approach to treating my form of deviation and will the cartilage be excised?",1

1471,"I was examined by an ETN dr. and I was told I had a slightly deviated septum. And I was wondering if fixing/straightening the septum would also improve my nose appearance(remove the hump and make nose straighter) or if improving the nose appearance would require a rhinoplasty as well. I've read that septoplasty doesn't change your nise shape, but I've also read that if a nose was crooked it could end up straighter after an operation.",1

I'm trying to avoid having a section of my nose removed permanently if possible. Thanks for your help.",1

1484,I have had a nasal septum deviation for several years now stemming from a broken nose when I was young. Over the years I have noticed that my eyes have started to appear very small which I think is a result of weak muscle tone. I also have been unhappy with how I look from the side.

I may be wrong and it may have been congenital and my septum was doomed in the first place. I did not mention to my ent doc that I used.

	I have a bump on my nose from previous trauma as a child as well as a deviated septum &amp; large turbinates. Therefore, I need to have a septoplasty/rhinoplasty/&amp; turbinate reduction performed. Upon researching doctors I came upon a plastic surgeon who could perform all of the above as well as another plastic surgeon who only can perform a rhinoplasty but would operate on me with an E.N.T who would address the other procedures. SO, which would it be wiser to choose?? PS, or PS &amp; ENT?

I am concerned about the cosmetic appearance of my nose however, and I have heard that the Septoplasty performed on the NHS only focuses on un-obstructing the airways of the nose and not on straightening the nose itself. I believe it is a Septo-Rhinoplasty that is required to improve function as well as straighten the nose for cosmetic reasons. Is this the case?",1
1502,"My ent surgeon told me that my septum was deviated (possibly from my nose breaking - don't remember when) and my turbinate was enlarged so that's why I had breathing problems and sinus infections. 4 years ago I used cocaine on the weekends and was wondering if this deviates a septum?

I also know that when someone breaks your know a small pool of blood gathers under the lower lash line kind of where people see bags form.

If that is a danger, is it possible to just take some cartilage from the 'narrow' side and move it to the other? Would such cartilage just be a loose 'piece' stuck under a blanket of flesh, or would it 'fuse' to what would be beneath? Thanks very much.

	Only the tip of my nose veers slightly on the left. It's just a little bit (something that I can notice and bothers me but most people can't notice). I am getting a septoplasty and sinus surgery. Will the septoplasty straighten the tip? Is it crooked because of the septum? Or would you have to get a Rhinoplasty to fix this?

	I have a deviated septum and have trouble with breathing and stuffiness on one side. I also get headaches fairly frequently. The ENT Dr. says the nostril is 90% blocked. I have no concern with the aesthetics of the exterior part of my nose, therefore I do not want a rhinoplasty. My only concern besides airflow is the uneven nostrils. Will straightening the septum improve the nostril symmetry? I&#39;m not looking for perfection, just wondering if there would be an improvement. Thanks

	I had a Septoplasty 4 months ago &amp; was breathing/sleeping great for the 1st time in @ 10 yrs. I broke my nose in two spots in the past, as a result it was slightly crooked, not too obvious, but breathing/sleeping were horrible. Hoping to finally fix the problem I met with a plastic surgeon who said I had a deviated septum and that he and an ENT would do the surgery. @ 2 weeks ago one nostril shut down again. Reasons, options-any info/ advise please... It would be so appreciated!

2591,"I have undergone extensive Septoplasty 10 days ago for a severely deviated septum. However, I couldn't help but notice now that the thin skin that used to cover my septum is not there anymore. I only feel what seems like plastic in my nose. Is this normal? Please help, I'm so worried. Is it ok if the skin never grows back and I just have the reinforced septum in my nose? Will this cause problems in later life?",1

	I have a deviated septum that has caused the bridge of my nose to look anything but straight. I also have a droopy nose, maybe something similar to the way penelope cruz nose droops.I like the droop my nose has, i just want my septum straightened.I went to a famous rhinoplasty surgeon in BH and he told me he couldn&#39;t fix my septum without having to mess with the tip of my nose. He showed me how my nose would look with the tip work and claimed that my nose would collapse w out it. Is this true?

	I noticed over the last 5 years my septum has kind of shifted and now my nose isn&#39;t symmetrical. How can I fix this? Would this cost as much as a full nose job? I don&#39;t want anything but this straight and to have nostrils the same size again!

	I broke my nose about 4 weeks ago, and now my nose is crooked, i'm having trouble breathing. I just want it to be straight again, but my dad's insurance doesn't kick in for a few months. I'm a student and we dont have much money. Should i go see a ENT, or would a plastic surgeon be a better choice?

	I don't have any breathing problems, but my nose has a bump in it that is affecting my self-esteem. Could septoplasty fix that? Also, what age would be appropriate for fixing a broken nose with surgery? I am a 13 year old girl.

	I am undergoing a Septoplasty and Turbinate reduction and would like to know if having just strictly a septoplasty aesthetically change the outward appearance of my nose?

2622,"I have a deviated septum and it makes it hard to breath. I have Medicaid and other insurance but I have been wanting to refine the tip of my nose as well to make everything look better. Will Medicaid cover the septoplasty still, or at all, and will I have to have two separate surgeries, or will I only have to pay for the reshaping?",1
2623,"I may have to have a Septoplasty but I also have a small dorsal hump that I want removed. I do not wish to change the shape of my nose, just to get the dorsal hump filed down in conjuction with my Septoplasty. Is that possible? Or will I have to possibly have further work done to my nose?",1
