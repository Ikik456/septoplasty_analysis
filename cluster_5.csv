4,"i have noticed asymmetry in my nose from the front as well as the side. I also have a slight bump on my nose which is more noticeable on one side then the other. I also constantly feel like one side of my nose is more blocked then the other, do i have a deviated septum?",5
5,My 16 month old headbutted me last week. I just had a septoplasty in July of this year because my 2 year old headbutted me and I couldn't breathe well on the right side. Now I cannot breathe well on the right side again. Can you tell if this is a deviated septum. There is a reddish pink area that I think I see blocking the opening.,5
21,I have a flat nose with a button tips that I do love but my nostrils are uneven. The left side is higher and more narrow but the right side is wider and lower? I love my nose and don't want to change the shape of it. But my uneven nostril make my life a living hell. I even have post nasal drip and dry mouth I don't know if it linked to my nostril shape. Anyways what treatment can help me even out this problem. Septoplasty? Fillers? Help thank you,5
33,"Would I be a good candidate for a Septoplasty? My nose is crooked, mainly towards my right nostril. My breathing feels slightly restricted but it's hard to tell as it's been this way forever. It also bothers me that it's so sideways.",5
41,My ENT consultant said that I have a deviated septum and he said some cartilage would be taken from my ear to build up the left nostril but that would make my nose look wider and I dont want that. My left nostril appears higher up than my right one too. Would the nostril asymmetry improve just with a septoplasty?,5
43,Ive seen two different doctors. One an ENT and the other a plastic surgeon. I have a deviated septum and my nose is starting to tilt more on the right side. Can a septoplasty and fixing the deviated septum fix this or should I get a septoplasty and rhinoplasty. I dont really want to change the look of my nose I just want it to not tilt to one side as much. When I breathe in my right nostril caves in aswell which I believe is called a nasal valve collapse. I also have very bad tmj.,5
46,"I had a septorhinoplasty two years ago. Because of trauma to face, i redeviated my septum and also collapsed a nasal valve on the right side. My nose bridge no longer looks as defined as it did post surgery, and surgeons have told me that septoplasty is required. an ENT put a camera in my nostrils and showed me the wall shifting to one side extremely. also, inhaling makes my nose collapse on one side. He says goal is to make my right side of nose(collapsed) look like the left. is this possible?",5
59,"Pictures below roughly provide the positioning of my cartilage. How likely is this to be causing my impeded breathing and sinus pressure in cold weather? It's extremely uncomfortable/distracting physically, gets caught on the right side of the septal wall when moving my face and is irritating/drying the lining of my nostril. I also have maxillary lateral incisor agenesis on the left, same side of the septal deviation(coincidence?) and I'm planning an implant which requires bone grafting.",5
62,Im having a rhinoplasty &amp; have a deviated septum. Do I need a septoplasty if i breathe much better out of my left nostril &amp; barely through the right side 95% of the time but sometimes when i lay down it switches &amp; I can only breathe out of the right side but never both at the same time well. Will a septoplasty help me breathe through both sides at all times? I also have a crooked nose that I want fixed &amp; a dorsal hump. Will a septoplasty help straighten my nose more as well?,5
65,"I suffered from trauma to the nose area at age 14. Ever since then, I cannot breathe very well from my right nostril. At 42, Im finally trying to address the problem as it seems to be affecting my sleep even more now. I had a CT scan to diagnose if I had a deviated septum. Results came back normal. Can a CT scan come back normal but a deviated septum exists that causes the nostril to be partially blocked?",5
74,"I have severe nasal congestion and mucous diacharge thorough out winters to the point that it disturbs my sleep. I have almost no sneezing. My doctor said I also have DNS and inferior meatal hypertrophy and should have a septoplasty done so will it help? Also I have a bump on the left side of my nose where the septum is deviated and I feel the bump has increased in,size over time(others have observed too) will septoplasty correct it too? I'm 23",5
80,"Last year I had a septoplasty to improve my breathing and help with snoring, my nose wasnt that crooked before but it did lean to one side, after my surgery I did notice that it was still leaning over to one side and the doctor had claimed I had a perforation in my septum now as well, I waited a full year to see if it would straighten out and it never did my breathing only slightly improved but I still can only mainly breathe through my left nostril",5
89,So will this surgery make my nose more symmetrical as well as help my breathing ? Will a septoplasty make my nostril thats smaller and higher up more even to the other? I cannot breathe out of the nostril thats smaller and higher up,5
94,"I can barely get any air through my obstructed nostril. Right now, it takes me about 8s and 36s to inhale and exhale through my unobstructed and obstructed side respectively. I would like to know if this is normal or if I should get my deviated septum fixed. Some sources say it's normal to always breathe through one nostril at a time, others say one side should 'inhale more air than the other', while again others say it's 'noticeable while having a cold'. So which one is it?",5
97,I had a bad result with a rhinoplasty 26 years ago and it left my septum visible in my right nostril and my left nostril bigger thanks right.&nbsp;Will a septoplasty straighten my nose?Will a septoplasty sort this out?,5
109,"If so, what treatment would I need to correct this? And, could this be the reason why I don't like the way my nose looks currently? I feel it may look wider on one side than the other? Does this affect the outer appearance of one's nose?",5
127,"I had a severe deviated septum as a child and as a result needed two septoplasties, one at 17 and another at 19. My septum curved back a bit after the first surgery and I stopped being able to breathe out of both sides of my nose, necessitating the revision. Since the revision surgery 8 years ago Ive been able to breathe functionally. The bottom of my septum is still curved but at this point its a cosmetic issue rather than functional. Can that curve be straightened or is it too risky?",5
133,"My nose is crooked, I can't breathe out of my right nostril and my nose curves to the right. And I always have a sore throat if that had anything to with the problem.",5
145,"I refuse to accept the answers this is just due to being swollen. My breathing was perfect the first couple weeks after surgery then just declined. Saw another surgeon for 2nd opinion said 80% blocked left nostril and 50% right. My nose seems wider due to spread grafts, still curved and worse breathing than before surgery. I feel this is not my fault but now burden of a revision what are my options?",5
146,"I have a significantly deviated septum which is taking a toll on my self esteem. Both sides of my face are vastly different in appearance. I'm actually very happy with the appearance of the left-side of my face and shape of my nose etc, and would like mostly to have both sides look more like the left. Is this possible thru surgery? Will I be able to keep my original nose shape but correct the asymmetry and have both sides look more like it is on left?",5
148,I received Septoplasty 2 years ago to straighten my deviated septum. I still cant breathe right and I feel like my right side of my nose is collapsed and my nostril looks uneven. Please help me look into this. Thanks,5
152,"About five years ago, I had a septoplasty with turbinoplasty to correct a deviated septum and to help alleviate chronic sinus infections and headaches. In the years since the surgery, I've noticed my left nostril has changed shape and has a bit of a ridge that you can feel that pushes outward, rather than allowing my natural curve in my nostril. I'm wondering if this could be from the surgery or if it is something else entirely.",5
153,"I had my procedure almost exactly a year ago and after about 4 months, my right nostril became noticeably higher than my left nostril. What could be the cause of this change in position and can it be fixed?",5
157,"I have always noticed my left nostril is much larger and more wide than the right, and I find it more difficult to breathe on the right side. Do you think I need and would qualify for a septoplasty?",5
173,"I had a septoplasty in 2016. Was deviated to the right. I now find myself blocked on the left. The right side is now ok Mucosa is inflaming to a point where the left is blocked. Pressurised environments also affect on the left, being in cars and trains. My mucosa was always susceptible to rhinitis however it seems that moving septum more to the left the inflammation that once was not an issue for the left is now an issue My breathing is good at times but these are short occasions Any advice?",5
175,I had a septorhinoplasty about two months ago and I noticed a very tiny hole where my septum is on the inside of my right nostril (I am not sure how deep it is but it is about the size of a dot mark made by a thin pen) sometimes I notice it makes breathing more difficult when I inhale. Does a hole that size repair itself? Are there any treatments to seal it?,5
179,I cant breath from the right nostril and have a bump.&nbsp;I had septoplasty surgery in 2018. After the surgery my nose seemed fine for the most part until recently that a bump on the bridge on my nose appeared and I cant breath from my right nostril again.,5
181,"The first thing I noticed post sinus surgery and septoplasty was that my eyes looked different (less of the left eye is showing and more of the right eye is showing). Im also experiencing strain and stiffness in my right eye, especially when focusing on something. Doctors have not found anything on scans / MRIs and there is no enophthalmos. Does anything jump out when looking at these photos? The sinus surgery was over 14 months ago. Thank you.",5
186,"I am sure my nose was always slightly like this, but in the past year or so I have felt that my nose became increasingly crooked and it became harder to breathe out of it (one side in particular). When I look in photos, it seems to be even worse and the under view looks to me like a deviated septum. Is this just a deviated septum and is septoplasty the appropriate fix? If so, what is the process for doing so (do I start with a GP referral?), and what is the estimated cost?",5
188,"I have a small white piece of what looks like bone sticking out of my septum on one side of my nose (the originally deviated side), this side of my nose is also more sensitive and if i lightly touch that side, I can feel it in my whole septum. I have been very careful not to bump my nose and have been sleeping elevated since the surgery, I use q tips soaked in saline to clean the nose and apply antibiotic treatment. Could my septum have shifted on its own and caused the cartilage to expose itself?",5
198,"Fine with my nose shape, but it looks like it leans left because of the lateral cartilage? Also looking into maybe a lip lift simultaneously if anyone has any information on that/doing it at the same time.",5
203,i got septoplasty and partial turbinate reduction(IT and Mt 10) on right side weaks before I can feeling air sensection on right side of nose how much time it take to turbinate nerves to heeal plz help,5
204,"Had a septoplastia rinoplastia (more septoplasty) on my right nostril as I couldn't breathe through it properly. Just had the surgery and upon checking when lifted my face to check my nostrils, it appears the outside tip of my nose appears bent? Also I was told excess cartilage was to be removed from my right nostril but still appears from the outside wider (sticking out) more than the left cartilage of the nose? Is this all normal for recovery?",5
211,The right side of my nose do get very stuffy compared to my left side.,5
214,"I can usually breathe through my nose, but only out of one or the other and not both at the same time. I do have a crooked nose, which may have been the result of sport related trauma when I was in high school. I am 22 years old now, and am thinking on getting it fixed. What procedure is right for me?",5
215,"Ive seen an ENT a couple years ago who suggested surgery, but I dont think my insurance covers it. Mostly Im annoyed that I cant breathe out of one side that always feels clogged and painful&mdash;but aesthetically I want to make my nose straight and symmetrical. The slant makes one side of my face droop and I cant stand it. What are my options?",5
222,My left nose still feels swelled and unnatural 7 weeks after septoplasty. Air flows are great but would this feeling of swelling goes away? I also have lots of mucus produced that seems to be trapped in the back of left nose.,5
240,&nbsp;Also feels like this side is now much smaller than the other side due to this scar tissue? I thought that septoplasty only involves working in the upper part of the nose? Dr says to give it time (its been 2 and a half months) already but I cant see it getting better- scarring too thick!?,5
243,"
	I&#39;m 23 years old, healthy, nonsmoker. I feel like my nose is crooked and throwing off the general symmetry of my face. I also have noticed my right nostril seems to be working noticeably harder than the left, and I often get nosebleeds from that side. Do you think I could benefit from these procedures? I wouldn&#39;t want to go through the procedure unless if I&#39;m just being overly critical. Thanks.

246,"I went to an ENT specialist to have my nasal polyps removed. That was the only procedure we discussed and agreed on. While I was unconscious, he straightened my nose. I have an extra unsightly bump on my nose. Breathing is more difficult. To breathe through my nose I have to push up the left side of the nose he straightened. My left nostril is lower than my right. My left side of the lips is also lower than the right side. How can i get this reversed? His operation notes are illegible.",5
247,"I had a septoplasty on the right side of my nose in feb 2017 which went well and helped a lot with my breathing. Suddenly my right airway has blocked completely, I feel like I always need to blow my nose but I don't. Can't breath at night anymore. I've tried taking antihistamines and using my nasal spray, they're not any difference. Has my septum gone back to being deviated? The mucus is travelling down my throat and making me sick.",5
249,"Im 5 weeks post-op from septoplasty, tip refinement, spreader grafts. From the front view, one side of my nostril looks lower than the other, and from the side, it has more nostril show so it looks lopsided in pics. Is that swelling? Theres also a dent on bridge my doc says its swelling?",5
271,I had a septoplasty about five months ago and I still can not breathe and now my nostril is going kind of sideways and the other one is straight up up before they were going both straight up they were almost even to each other (nothings perfect) but now I have one completely off.,5
279,"Im about 3 weeks post-op and my follow up with my ENT is not for another three months. Ive been doing daily saline rinses, humidifier at night and applying neosporin/nasal gel. My concern is the feeling of tightness on my left side close to my nostril, where the incision was made. Is the white looking areas cartilage or a phase of the healing process? It is bumpy, hard and makes my nostril appear narrow compared to the other side. Mouth movement and eating seems to affect how tight it feels.",5
295,"I had a Septoplasty in April this year, all went well and I now can breathe a lot better through my right nostril, since this surgery and has got worse as the time gone on. My throat is extremely dry all the time, I cannot produce any mucus on the right hand side and to be fair I have very little on the left which makes my throat extremely dry that it feels like I have an obstruction/narrowed? Is this normal or is there anything I can do to help? Thank you Im advance. Craig",5
296,I am two weeks post septoplasty. I notice that when I scrunch my nose using both sides of my face my nostrils raise up.However I notice if I alternate the sides I do not get the same results. Right side scrunch will lift right side nostril Left side scrunch does not lift left nostril . I was told by a medical doctor not an ENT that it could be a severed muscle in the nose done during the procedure.,5
298,"How long to see improvement with breathing? Possible nerve/muscle damage? I could not breathe out of the left side of my nose. It was determined that I had a deviated septum. I had a septoplasty , columella reduction ( left side of nose ) and Bilateral inferior turbinate outfracture and reduction done 10 days ago. The doctor completed the septoplacy by accessing the right side of the nose (nostril with no breathing issues). Breathing has not improved on the left side. Swelling but no numbing .Able to move right side of nose up and down but not the left side .",5
302,"Dear ENTs I had a deviated septum surgery and&nbsp;turbinate reduction 2 years ago. I'm still&nbsp;congested on right side at night and had radio coblation a year later. Still&nbsp;no help. These photos are post both of the above procedures. At night, my right side swells tremendously to 100% blockage and the pressure wakes me up. Is there any help that I can receive for this? This CT is recent and is after all of the previous work. It is my current condition.",5
309,"I had a septoplasty in 2012; my septum re-deviated afterward but my nasal breathing was still greatly improved so I didn't feel the need to fix it. However the other day I got hit with a ball on the same side of my nose the septum had deviated to. It wasn't a hard impact, it doesn't hurt, but now I'm feeling like that side of my nose is congested or that my septum looks more deviated when I look in the mirror. Could the impact have weakened the septal wall causing it to deviate more than before?",5
313,"I donot have a major breathing problem, i am having repeated sinus infections and post nasal drips which causes sore throat. My nasal septum is slightly deviated to the right and i also have adhesion (from a previous surgery) near the middle turbinate on the right side. My doctor has recommended septoplasty, he will also be removing adhessions. Will septoplasty put an end to my sufferings.",5
323,"All my life had a sever deviated septum blocking the right side. Hypertrophied turbinates on both sides. After septoplasty and sub mucous resection of turbinates, when just breathing through right side I feel out of breathe compared to left. They are not blocked both as equal as possible. Could this be that the mucosa on the blocked side isn't used to airflow and needs to adapt, as it always feels blocked so I know it's not just the nasal cycle.",5
326,"I had septoplasty and turbinate reduction 2 months ago, and for the last 6 weeks or so, I feel constant phlegm at the back of my left nose (incision made this side during surgery) and above the throat and I cannot clear it. It's always there and it's annoying. It gets worse when I eat or drink. Is this still an adjusting thing from my surgery? If so would this get better in time? Or should I consult the doctor? Thank you so much.",5
342,One side of my tip feels harder and perhaps even higher than the other. Is that a part of the healing process? I'm around one month post-op. Grafts used for the septorhinoplasty: Spreader On-lay Chips,5
349,"I had septorhinoplasty done 40 days ago. I had the width of my bridge reduced, tip refined and the height of my nose from the side profile reduced. Previously I had perfectly symmetrical nostrils but now they seem to be uneven. My right nostril looks slightly pointy as compared to the left one. The side profile from the right also looks different from the left. Can it be because of the swelling or is my right nostril notched? What can I do about it if its notched?",5
350,"Can someone help me here. I am 3 weeks out of this surgery. I thought I was only having septoplasty but then seen the other had been done to. I'm so scared of the horrer stories of people getting ens from turbinate reduction. . I go for a 3 week followup tommorow to see how I'm healing. The thing is, I look in the mirror and the turbinates look the same size as before surgery. The right side has always been bigger then left. It's still that way. Is this a normal looking size turbinates?",5
351,I had a septoplasty and it appears there is a bony protrusion in the back of the nasal cavity extending off the nasal sidewall on the Left side. Something feels different on the left side in a negative way that is not easy to explain but Im wondering if this should be removed or if it is even possible?,5
356,After a month of throbbing pain on the left side of my nose with numbness on my left cheek and a feeling of pressure my doctor said it is a nerve in my cheek. Will this go away? Its been 37 days since my surgery. I also have a small visible suture (absorbable) where the incision is an a small area that hurts.,5

399,"I had a septoplasty done 5 days ago for my deviated septum. My right nostril is completely clear of gunk but my left is still completely blocked. When I shine a torch into it, there is a huge blob of gunk at the back of my nostril that just wont come out, no matter how many times I flush. I cant blow my nose yet as my septum is still healing, but Im worried this blob wont detach. Will this blob of gunk eventually come out? Im worried that it wont since my other nostril is clear now!",5
402,I had septhoplastic on my nose 2 months ago for a deviated Septum and had rhinoplasty to narrow my nose only the nasal bones were broken. The right side of my nose where the soft tissue is looks different from the left. Is this normal or might be scarring tissue that is not allawing the skin to flatten?,5
406,"I had septoplasty and turbinectomy about two months ago and Ive been following all the post op procedures, I had a really deviated septum and I thought itll be back to being straight which it isnt but I can slightly breath better from the gap as shown in photos. Is it normal to be like this ? Pics are shown of closed up nostril and left nostril which isnt blocked.",5
409,Im having septoplasty with a graft on my left nostril and rasping.&nbsp; My nose was broken twice once hit on the left side when I was younger. The resulted in my nose deviating into an S shape on the bridge rotating my top to the right. Ive had a consultation with a surgeon whom has proposed a septoplasty and a graft to my right nostril for support along with bridge rasping. Im surprised that it doesnt require breaking/resetting. Is a good result possible to correct the bridge with just rasping? Thank you in advance.,5
423,"I had a rhinoseptoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery 1 week ago. Today I had my cast removed on the outside of my nose and removal of the packing inside of my nose. The packing on my left was not found. The left side was much more swollen and the surgeon made 3 attempts to try and find the packing. The left side was extremely painful and we stopped after the 3 attempts. He thinks I may have swallowed the packing on the left or that it is further up. It was so painful, I'm afraid to go back.",5
431,"I have underwent Septoplasty two weeks before due to Deviated septum. Now the pain has reduced and last day, The surgeon took off the remnants of the stitches inside my nostrils and cleaned my nose. Now my nostrils are clean but still I feel difficulty in breathing through both the nostrils at a time. When the left nostril is opened (can breathe very smoothly), I feel burning pressure and block in the right nostril. After some time, the same is happening vice versa. Is it normal",5
435,"I had closed rhynoplasty and septoplasty 2 days ago , I have a lot of swelling which I expected, but my diviated septum has diviated the other side compleatly blocking my nostril, is that because my surgeon performed closed rhinoplasty in the other nostril? Causing the septum to swell over to the other side ? Please help I'm getting worried !",5
436,Septoplasty- 05/22/18 A stitch blew in my left nostril yesterday and my left nostril is sore. I notice the left nostril opening is narrowing again. Is the surgery botched over one blown suture? And is it natural for the nostril to narrow post-op? Also- the stitch itself is very hard.,5
445,"I have a very small posterior septal perforation, and I get a slight 'twinge of discomfort' on my left side way back in my nose by my nasal wall and middle turbinate. I notice that when I cover my right nostril and breathe in the discomfort is gone. Perhaps the airflow in my nose is coming through the right side then through the perforation to the left and hitting my nose in such a way that it acts almost like a contact point irritation somewhere near the turbinate and bony valve?",5
454,"Its fat and big. It also hurts a lot and is tender to the touch (all which I know is common). Its just the size of it right now, are the splints the reason why my nose hasnt reduced in swelling yet? Im feeling unsettled and just need to know if my nose is going to return back to its shape. Ive attached a picture of my swollen nose as of right now and my nose prior to surgery. I would love some information and support on this.",5
458,"I was hit in the side of the face a year prior, which is speculation for my deviated septum. I did the surgery because of severe blockage and sinus headaches. Nasal bone and cartilage were removed plus turbinates were reduced. At 3 week follow up, scarring had grown together so my doctor cut it apart. 3 Months later, my left side (where the deviation occurred) is SO narrow, I constantly have to pull my cheek to provide relief, especially when I am trying to sleep where gravity is against me.",5
462,The left side of my nose looks massive while the right side looks tiny. My nostrils are asymmetrically placed as well. Will a septoplasty fix this? Or will I need a rhinoplasty as well? I have a deviated septum,5
471,"I was punched in the nose and Im a candidate for a septoplasty. Severe valve collapse. 100% on one side and 70% on the other. In addition, it caused a dorsal hump on my nose that actually hurts me. When I breathe, it feels like that cold/sore sensation in that area which also causes headaches all the time. I know insurance doesnt cover it, but am I looking at thousands of dollars to shave the hump? Do I have a pinched look nose also? It also leans towards the left now some.",5
473,"Im 20 now and when at age 7, a bump on my nose bridge started to grow to where it is quite visible from a side view of my face and you can see a sharpish point on the sides of the bump; also my left nostril is blocked inside. With any form of pressure on it, I get a tickle-y feeling like I'm about to sneeze and a really painful headache follows. I only noticed the pain when I tried wearing any pair of glasses but now it could be the lightest pressure that triggers a weighty, lengthly headache.",5
478,I got my septoplasty done on April 6th of last year and it was all going good after my packing got taken out of my left side. But now I have even more trouble breathing. My nose whistles all the time on the left (theres no boogers too so that cant be it) And in the mirror I can see that my nostril looks like a slit not even a proper air way. What can i do to fox this?? I dont know just how urgent it is to fix it. I'm also in a 8month program for school so I want to know if I need to ask for time off.,5
479,"It has been 6 days since I had a septorhinoplasty and yesterday I noticed that the splint in my left nostril was falling out. This morning, it is about 1 centimeter from being out of my nose. The right nostril is completely fine, but I am having discomfort and mild pain in my left one due to this. I tried to reach my surgeon but it is a weekend and the only way to talk to him is to page him which is for emergencies. What should I do and why is the splint coming out? Will this affect any results?",5
484,My insurance pre authorized a septum repair and bilateral alar graft. I know my nose may be slightly wider and I'm okay with that. Also will my tip come up every so slightly? It's a tiny bit dropy in my opinion Or will it remain identical . I assume it will come up a bit simply due to the alar grafts placed for my right side nasal collapse.. ....lastly why bilateral grafts when only the right nostril is collapsing?,5
487,Ive always been self conscious of where the sides of my septum show in profile pictures. I feel as though it adds to the size of the profile of my nose.,5
496,When i was younger Ive had many incidents of trauma to my nose. I never went to the hospital after any of the incidents. I was wondering if i developed a dorsal hump from a fracture/broken nose or did my nose break and heal crooked. I had septoplasty and sinus surgery two months ago because of trouble breathing. I still have trouble breathing from my left nostril which is slimmer than my right nostril because of the unevenness.,5
498,Is it possible to have turbinate reduction after I have already had a septoplasty? I am 3 weeks post op from septoplasty and and worried about still not being being able to breathe through my right nostril. I know there is still probably some swelling inside but when I look inside the nose the turbinate looks very small on the right and very open on the left. I am just worried that the septoplasty I just had did not correct my breathing issue.,5
505,"My nostrils switch off on which one is closed (both are never closed at the same time).One day my left nostril's inferior turbinate will be bulged up,in a day or so this will switch to my right (laying on my side tends to have some effect on speeding this up).My Dr suggested Celon Wand (similar to radiofrequency/coblation),said it was mucosa sparing so ENS risk was low.If I undergo the procedure when my right side is clogged,but a day later my right side opens up,am I at risk for ENS or similar?",5
517,"I recently had two septoplasty done before in the past. The second one was to fix the nasal valve from collapsing. However, Im in a different country, and I was hit in the nose again. When I put my hand up both nostril the nasal bone seems to be more so on the right side. I cant blow air out of it, and at night I wear nasals strips, and I can cant breathe on my right side, and my left nasal still collapses. Do you think I need a third one?",5
535,"I want to start off saying that I had an deviated septum surgery about 4 years ago. I have a septal perforation on the right side of my nose. It has become big to the point that my right cheek looks a bit flat and the tip of my nose has changed shape. I am having difficulty breathing, dry nose, congestion, pain from time to time, and numbness mostly head area. I am not sure what to do at this point.",5
538,Im really really worried I messed something up will I be okay?? Im really freaked out because I can fully see them on this right side like the whole thing but not at all on my left and ima fraud its something I did and it will make my nose heal crooked. I was messing too much with my nose it had felt like I have a clump of blood stuck in my right side and Im afraid I moved the splint ?,5
541,"Hi, will a septoplasty straighten the bottom of the nose because obviously it is crooked thats what is causing the breathing problem is assume. Also I will provide pictures of what I have. The first picture is me now and the second picture is my goal, my nostril is open so it makes it look like my nose is droopy. Is it possible for the surgeon doing the septoplasty to remove that extra cartridge or something thanks?",5

	Hi, I had a septoplasty at the end of August this year, The issue im having is, before my op my right nostril was blocked due to a deviated septum, After the op, blockage is still there but redcued, but recently my left nostril is completely blocked. I've tried using my rinse and i've tried my decongestion spray but neither work, it just feels like i need to blow something huge out. could my nose deviate to the other side? or could this just be a lot of 'gunk' that will move in time.
",5
554,"You can see it alot in the photo I have added, most times it's just one nostril higher then the other it seems but VERY noticable. I hate it and it hinders my quality of life. My nose was never like this until I got jumped by six guys at night time. I have breathing problems, alot of clearing my throat, congested alot.. etc Does it look Deviated? If I got a septoplasty would it fix the nostrils to where one isn't higher then the other by straightening the septum? It was never like this before. Thanks.",5
585,"But the doctor simply moved the bone to the center, he did not do anything else. So skin at the tip of my nose is still to one side, and there is an excess of skin in one nasal. Also one of my nostril bases is set further back. What can be done to help make my nose normal again. I wasn't born this way, around the 4th grade my septum became deviated.",5
600,"I am 23, going on 24. The first five photos are of my left side &mdash;the side Im unhappy with. It appears like my septum is deviated towards that side, leaving me with a bulbous tip and not much definition overall. I also cant breathe well through this nostril, either. I have a mild connective tissue disorder and have strategies to mitigate complications, as well. Thank you!",5
614," I had a septoplasty/rhinoplasty 6 weeks ago with an ENT and a plastic surgeon. The plastic surgeon inserted spreader grafts (2 on the right, 1 on left) and shaved down the dorsal bump. The ENT corrected my deviated septum &amp; turbinate reduction. Since then I have always felt my left nostril is partially blocked but I can breathe fine out of the right. I saw my ENT yesterday and he says my septum is straight and it should resolve. I haven't felt much improvement, will this get better?",5
628,I have sustained many injuries to my nose over the past 10 years. I have a large hump on the bridge of my nose that has built up over the years and also regularly get sinus infections. I have had a lot of trouble breathing through my right nostril most days but I can't breathe through it at all when my allergies flare up. I have very basic health insurance and I guess the biggest question is the cost of repairing my deviated septum and if the hump could also be removed during the procedure.,5
631,"I had a septolplasty 5 weeks ago. My left nostril is completely closed and a 2nd ENT who Did not perform the surgery said its clearly deviated and a CT scan shows that is deviated and that's the reason I cant breathe through my left nostril. The surgeon who performed the surgery said that's how it's supposed to be, it's just swollen. It's clearly not swollen, but very visibly deviated. How long do I need to wait to have a revision? The feeling I have in my nose is unbearable and I need relief",5
640,"
	Hi. I very much like one side of my nose (the side profile and even an angle profile) but not the other side as they are very different will a septoplasty fix this?
",5
664,"I have a deviated septum, my left eye droops, and my mouth is lower on the right side. I know I need a septorhinoplasty, but I'm not sure about the eye. The bone above the left eye is lower than on the right, and I am pretty sure (based on manipulating my face in the mirror) that a simple blepharoplasty could not pull the left high enough to match the right. As to the mouth, would some sort of filler work? Also, how should I spread out the treatments, and what would the approximate cost be? Thx!",5
665,"I can only breathe out of one nostril at a time. It switches sides occasionally. If I cover one nostril (lets say the right) with my finger I can't breathe through my left. But, if I cover my left, I can sometimes breathe out of my right. However, the sides switch. Some days I can breathe only through the right; whereas some days I can only breathe through the left. Very often I can not breathe out of either side. My nose also curves to the right.",5
683,I had a septoplasty last Thursday. I had my apparently one and ONLY post op follow up visit Monday. I was told everything looked good however my nose looks crooked to me and my nostrils look uneven. The deviation was on the right side and that nostril looks fine the left looks widened. I had splints and gel packing. I know it's only 5 days post op but I am nervous that it's permanent. Will my nostrils be even again and my nose less crooked is this normal?,5
688,I had a minor deviation of nasal septum and some small cysts in sinuses. The surgeon said that the cysts are not a issue and only septum deviation should be fixed. The intervention went well but it seems that the wounds haven't healed completely even after 5 months. One nostril which was affected by septum deviation is still filled with mucus in the morning and I started to feel some pain in the left part of the nose. I use saline sprays for a long time and 0 effect.,5
690,"Hi i had Septoplasty and turbenectomy three months ago. After surgery my inside of my lip , from my teeth upwards , were also purple. Now I have what feels like a hard bone under the skin in my right nostril. There is pressure on the bridge of my nose and also feels like the septum is preasing against this bony structure. What could it be?",5
693,"Whats wrong my with nose? The left nostril is huge, like i mean huge and it is not as easy to breathe through it as the right one. It doesn't look like a deviated septum to me, im just not sure whats wrong with me. I really do not want to have a surgery i hate anesthetic but i would rather be awake for the operation. can someone please help? i have had this problem for around a year now, it is very unsightly. maybe it is enlarged nasal turbbinates?",5
699,"Directly after the surgery my airflow felt nearly perfect. Of course, a few hours later I was completely swollen and had 0 airflow. Now the swelling has gone down a bit and I am getting some airflow but only through one nostril or the other and it switches back and fourth. Sometimes I get air through both but it is not as clear as when only one is working. Is it possible something went wrong or is this normal?",5
700,I had a trauma a month ago. My friend hit me with a cap on my nose. My nose septum is deviated since birth and shifted to left side. But after trauma i have a bumpy type thing on the edge of left side of my nose it feels like a bump and thick skin its emerged outward. It changed my nose appearance little bit. In center the top of my Septum is touching the roof of nasal wall i guess its the reason of bump or is it upper Cartilage??? Will septoplasty fix this ? Just dont want this bump,5
705,"The inside of my left nostril has a bulge that the right side does not, as if the center of my nose is off of alignment. I had a septoplasty performed in August of 2016, and just had another performed last week (which was to open Nasal valves as the doctor thought they may be collapsing.) This all started when I noticed I have been having a harder time breathing through one side of my nose than the other. Is it possible the Nasal Valve reconstruction needs more time?",5
713,"I had a septoplasty and rhinoplasty at the same time 2 weeks ago, I just got my nose splints removed today and i could breath perfectly, later in the day out of nowhere i couldnt breath through my right nostril anymore. Previously my septum blocked my left nostril but now my right one is blocked out of nowhere and it feels like i need to blow something out but no matter what i do it stays blocked",5
714,"* I had a septoplasty + turbinate reduction + vestiblar stenosis repair 22 days ago * My left nostril still feels ~90% blocked. In contrast, my right nostril has been open since day ~14 after my nose was vacuumed * It doesn't feel like I have that much remaining gunk (blood, mucus, etc.) in my left nostril, so I'm growing concerned around what's blocking it * My doctor said to wait for 3 months, but I don't feel like my left nostril is improving * Note that I have a relatively narrow nose",5
723,Hi. I had a septoplasty 1 year ago where they removed cartilage from the septum as it was deviated. Now around 1 month ago I had a septoplasty revision as I couldn't breathe through the one side still. So they re aligned everything and now around 1 month after the surgery I still can't breathe properly. One day I can breathe through the bad side and not the good side. And then some days it's other way around. Looking up the operated side. The airway is very small Other side it's open normal,5
729,I have enclose my prescription before opertn Now my problem is that not able to breathe And face blockage of left nostril And my right nostril is properly fine Can u tell why so And when it will b all right,5
733,"I had a septoplasty weeks ago after having a deviated septum to the right. I was always obstructed on that side. If I could breathe 100% oh the left I was probably 10% on the right. After the septoplasty I noticed all the cuts and stiches were on the left, and the left side was wide open. The right appeared untouched and completely blocked. Also the doctor did not insert any splints on either side, which worries me are they not necessary? He decongested me on the right and but it closed up again",5
737,"When the splints were removed I could breathe! It got better each week. However, after about 6 months the bad side started to feel blocked again. I'm getting sinus infections again. I can't breathe out of my nose when I lay down. The bridge of my nose is now visibly flat. I also have a crease that runs halfway across the bottom portion of the bridge towards the tip. All of these things were not present before my surgery. Any advice?",5
738,"I was given a nasal douche from the hospital after my surgery last Monday(7days ago). I've done it a few times but when I used it to wash out my nose today, all the stitches came out of my left nostril, my right was fully intact. When checking my right later on in the evening, I found that I couldn't feel my right stitches anymore. Is this cause for concern or am I just over thinking it? Is it too soon for them to have completely fallen out?",5
748,It has been almost 2 weeks since my septoplasty w/ SMR of my turbinates. I do feel a lot of air coming in but it feels like I'm breathing through a snorkel. It's loud and despite getting a lot of air I feel like I'm out of breath. It gets worse in the evening and has been effecting my quality of sleep. The air is dry and cold. Originally my breathing was a little blocked on one side due to an injury that took place a few months ago but it wasn't terrible. Is this ENS?,5
751,"Now I can breath very well from my left nostril but my right nostril is completely blocked. I went to see my surgeon because of this and my nose started to smell very bad. He removed a crust from my right nostril and it seems to have fixed the smell, however the nostril is still blocked. My doctor told me it should feel much better without the crust so I was expected to see some improvements but it's been a few days and I can't see any improvements. I'm quite worried. Any thoughts? Thanks",5
759,"I have had two surgeries for my deviated septum. The first surgery was to repair both nostrils - which failed on both sides. A year later I had a second surgery that resulted in one side still blocked. It has been over a year since my second surgery and I really don't want to go back for a third, but it is very annoying having the constant feeling something is stuck in my nostril. I had the first surgery at 19 and am now 21.",5
760,"It's been 3 1/2 weeks post op and for the past week I've been experiencing a lot of drainage, Crustiness, blockage, and some slight wait around where the stitch was. It hurt slightly when I blow a little and one side is hard to breathe through and I took a flashlight and looked in my nose and it seems one side is closed/ very narrow.",5
767,I had a revision septoplasty to improve air flow in my right nostril and cautery of inferior turbinate in my left. My left airway already feels much more open with much less resistance and I'm finding it hard to regulate my breathing. It feels like I'm overinhaling and am much more conscious of my nasal breathing. This is causing a lot of anxiety. How long until I should get used to the new pattern of airflow?,5
768,"I had a septoplasty 1 month before in which my bone was cut from left nostril and now i am feeling more air pressure and tilted nose on my right nostril, another problem is i am having pain in my eyes and a tilted vison too. Is it normal to face such things?",5
775,"I have a deviated septum and my nose is crook from the mid part down. Also one nostril is smaller. My nose goes to the left. It seems like it is all tissue related and when I push the middle of my nostril straight, it makes it appear straight. If I fix the deviated septum will it fix this nose lean to the left and will it also fix my nostrils being diff",5
809,The septal area inside of my nose is curved in on both sides (though more on the right than left). Is this a sign of a deviated septum? Or could it be a sign that a septal perforation is forming? Thanks,5
813,Hello. I have had septoplasty and turbinates reduction done on May 31. I was so happy to finally breath through my nose. But after a first night i had my left side congested again. I used a little bit of descongesting nasal spray and it helped but the whole point was to not use it any more. This sprays are not healthy to use So should i worry or it is a common thing and it will get better? The other thing is i had the packing taken out next day after the surgery. Is this may effect the result?,5
815,"Hi, so this upcoming August it will be a year since my septoplasty took place. The doctor said It wouldn't change the appreance at all since he was straighting the septum and scraping the side for better air flow. But I still cannot breathe as freely as I wish I would. I can hardly feel the difference. Is there a possibility that I have a collapsed valve ? On my right side especially since the right side of my nose curves outward.",5
818,"2 weeks ago I had a septrhinoplasty. My septum was deviated to my right side and was corrected but ever since surgery breathing through my left nostril has become increasingly worse. At my 2 week check up doctor said my septumn was now pulling to the left but this is normal as the goal is better breathing not perfect. However my left nostril is now almost completely blocked, if it was swelling shouldn't it be getting better not worse? And can a septum fall the opposite way it was fixed for?",5
837,My deviated septum causes my nose to be clogged all the time and also makes my nose curve to the right side at the tip because of the deviation. will a septoplasty fix the symptoms and the straightness of my nose?,5
843,"I got a turbinectomy and septoplasty to fix a slight deviated septum blocking my left nostril. After removing the splints on week later I could breath fine from both nostrils, but now, 3 days after, my left nostril is completely shut and feels worse than before. Did my septum shift back?",5
844,"Hi In 2013, i had a septoplasty for a deviated septum as the left side of my nose was always blocked. Even though i had the surgery, my nose would still be blocked and I would use sudofed to clear it as it gave me sinus headaches on that side. I had a CT scan and i had no sinus blockage. Four years on Ive been referred to a private hospital by my GP and he said i may need a revision septoplasty but my concern is it didnt work the first time, will septorhinoplasty help? I have a dorsal hump too",5
848,"I undergone a septoplasty that ruined my perfectly straight septum. Ever since I got this surgery my health has been on the decline. Before the surgery I only had a minor problem, mucous and swelling. My breathing wasn't affected at all. After the surgery, my septum is curved to the left to the point where it almost touches the other side of my nostril. My breathing has gotten way worse. My nose has lost its moisture. The septum is always dry. My problem is the severely bent septum.",5
850,"I had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction 11 weeks ago and about 30% of my day, I can breathe better than ever, but the rest of the day my breathing is just as bad as before the surgery if not worse. I'll be sitting at home on the computer like I am right now breathing great through my nose and then all of a sudden I try to inhale to test my breathing and I'm blocked. Is this normal for the improved breathing to be present one moment and not the next? Am I experiencing swelling from surgery?",5
853,"I had septoplasty about six months ago.I am still not able to breathe through right side of the nose. The condition seems to worsen daily. Now when I go to doctor, they say that there is no problem in my nose. I also have headache on the right side where my nose is blocked.I want to get rid of this problem as soon as possible. Please somebody help me",5
860,"I absolutely despise the way my nose look. The tip of it doesn't look right, look like melting candle wax almost. I hate it. I am 99% sure that I have a deviated septum even though my Mom and family doctor said I don't. I can barely breathe out of my left nostril and it's very frustrating. The lines on the side of my nose bother me too, not sure what they're called. What would be the best solution for me? Septoplasty? Rhinoplasty? Both?? Please help and thanks so much in advance.",5
875,"I went to the doctor to get my nose checked because it tilts slightly to the left and really bothers me. I do not have much of a breathing problem unless I really focus on how I can breathe through my right nostril much better than my left. However, it's very subtle. The doctor told me I have a slight deviated septum only at the tip of my nose so surgery is not necessary since it does not impair my breathing. Would insurance cover surgery even if it is very minor?",5
876,"Whenever I breathe through my nose it is awfully loud, so i need to breathe through my mouth. I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma but I think I am just not able to breathe because of my nose. Also if i were to fix the septum would it make my nose more symmetrical and stop it from pointing down? The right side is fine but the left as you can see is very prominent in its sticking down and much larger.",5
880,"Hi, Today it is 3 weeks since I had septoplasty. He also removed the lower turbinates and some cycts. But I still is decongested in the same nostril (right) where I had problem with deviated septum. I can't sleep with only one pillow, I need two to be able to breath. When I look inside my nose it looks exactly as it did before surgery. Surgery was closed, incision right inside of the nose. I have done everything as told. Should I contact my surgeon or is this normal? Many thanks for answer!",5
882,HELP!!!! Right nostril collapsed so I had surgery to fix it and they shaved bone down also. While under they noticed these things in left nostril which required burning them off. Which was never something discussed till after which is to late. My issue and concerns is how crooket it looks now on the left. Is it swollen or something needs to be fixed on left to Make look better. It never was like this before and now I am so upset.,5
883,"I had a septoplasy 5 days ago. The nasel bone was in an S shape and so straightened to assist breathing at night. I realise i am early days but looking up the right nostril it appears there is hardly any gap. Initially there was but it seems to have got worse over the days instead of better. Can the nasel bone become swollen? Nose is still blocked and breathing through my mouth is awful. Wish i had done more research before doing this , not sure the doctor has made it worse. Thank you.",5
891,I recently started noticing that my nostrils look completely different from the other. In the left one I can't really see straight up into it and there's more cartilage/skin and the right one I can see completely inside of it and there's way less cartlidge. Is my septum deviated? Is the tissue damaged. I never really noticed til now and it's starting to bother me,5
893,I had septoplasty in 2016 and later found out I didnt even need it After surgery: A year later and my septum is deviated to the left by a lot. My left nostril is narrower than right. Air still passes through. The inside of my nose feels very bony all over and I feel the deviated septum right away. I cant even stick the tip of my finger into the left nostril because the cartilate is so curved to the left. My question is can I live with this if I treat my sinisitus or do I need revision surgery.,5
897,"The doctor told me it would come out on its own but I don't feel the difference. And I can't tell if the surgery was effective or not b/c on the left side of my nose when im breathing before the surgery the air comes out side ways and even after the surgery I can't tell the difference. And when I look side ways my nose is crooked which was straight before the surgery, I want to know if this is all normal or if it would get better? (At the moment I can't contact my Dr.)",5
898,"I had a septoplasty 2 1/2 weeks ago and just recently have been having a much harder time breathing, almost like when I still had my splints in. Also having numbness and the inside of my nose doesn't look too pretty. I looked in my nose and the one side still seems much smaller than the other. Wondering if I could have an infection or if the surgery actually made things worse.",5
910,"My nose is deviated towards the right side and it causes me some trouble breathing and I snore at night. Also, when I breathe the nostril on my right side closes completely if I breathe deeply, whereas the left side never fully closes. I know a septoplasty will correct the airflow issues, but is there a chance it will straighten my nose as well?",5
911,"I got Septo in Dec 2015 and supposedly the right deviated septum are straightened, the concha bullosa &amp; the turbinates are reduced in size. Nowadyas, I just noticed something that I never noticed before in my nose. During normal inhale/exhale, The sides of my nose (a little above nostrils) literally moves a bit (contract &amp; relax). The nostrils don't close but they shrink a bit on every inhale but this constant move is bugging me. Is this really normal or it is a sign of weaker alar cartilage?",5
921,will a septoplasty fill the crater forming in the tip of my nose from deviation? It is a hole that appeared to me in the last 2 years which seems to be getting deeper. I am planning on getting a septoplasty soon to fix my breathing there is a big bulge of cartlidge sticking out on my right nostril. Any chance of getting physical assyemty from the septoplasty or a rhinoiplasty is needed?,5
955,I had surgery to correct my deviated septum last week. I got my stents removed today and I can breathe through one nostril while the other is more stuffed up and i cant smell anything. Will this subside? Please tell me this will get better.,5
959,"Would a septoplasty help with the crooked appearnce of the nose and the little Wave-like humps near the nostril or would I have to break the bone and align it in the center? I do have trouble breathing and a concha bullosa on the left side of the nose, but I am very conscious of the appearance when taking pictures and I am curious which option is best to fix it externally....",5
962,"I got a septo/rhinoplasty almost a month ago. It was my left nostril that was slightly deviated but postop I could tell the right nostril felt a little deviated like they switched places. In fact, it almost feels a little worse than the left one now and it got increasingly so a couple days ago. I felt like that part of the surgery was a failure. Is it possible that it's still just swollen? How long until I could assume it's not going to get any better? Could some sort of collapse have happened?",5
965,I've recently had a septoplasty done and had the splints removed but noticed that the bump on my left nostril is still there from a severely deviated septum and I'm not feeling any real improvement on that side. I was informed that a septoplasty would fix this but I don't know if I wasn't clear with my doctor or if he made a surgical mistake? I'm able to breathe a bit better but the obstruction in the left nostril is still there and I would've thought that a septoplasty would fix this.,5
967,I am thinking of having a septorhinoplasty for my diviated septum and concave left tip side. My Danish surgeon Said he would do a closed septorhinoplasty and use septum cartiledge for my tip and reduce my turbinates. I dont want turbinate reduction is that nescersarry. I am afraid of Empty nose syndrom. Whats the risk of ENS in numbers after reduction of turbinates in one side where they burn the turbinate.,5
978,I received a septoplasty almost 2 years ago. After it I was able to breathe perfectly. I was able to breathe correctly for almost a whole year until recently I have noticed that I have lost almost complete function of my left nostril because my septum has curved over one again to the left side. I have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I thought the septoplasty would be the fix but it seems that it has returned back to normal.,5
980,So my nose wall/bone goes off to the side . My septum is doing it's job but the bone isn't . How will the septoplasty work out? My nose is like number one . #2 will completely mess up My nose i think .,5
992,I had a deviated septum on the left side of my nose.I had septoplasty and reconstruction a week ago. I can breathe perfect in and out of left nostril but now the right side of my nostril is stuffy I can almost not breathe in or out the right side of nostril. Why is this so? Is it effects after surgery? Will my right nostril go back to normal..everything looks straight and perfect?,5
994,"As the title says, could removing the inside mesh early that keeps the blood from coming out result in the corrected septum to come back or something? Is that even possible? I`m asking because one of the nostrils does not work as good as the other. I know it`s still swollen inside but shouldnt they both work the same? Is it normal for one to work so much worse than the other? Also, I have a small bump of meat on the inside of my nose that I did not have, you can see in the picture.",5
999,"Hello! A liitle over 2 weeks ago I had Septoplasty, Polyp Removal, Bilateral Sinus Surgery and Bilateral Alar Batten Graft Placements. The inside of my left nostril has considerable swelling, the right side has mild swelling. Is this normal? I had 1 Kenalog injection into the swollen tissue in my left nostril with no success.

The only thing that helps is using Otrivine nasal spray.... should I be worried??",5
1009,"One side is the result of my nose developing around a breathing tube after birth and it has been this way my whole life. The other side was left untouched and developed normally. I have difficulty breathing on the smaller side, especially when I have a cold. I don't really think I will need a septoplasty as, to my knowledge, only my nostrils are disfigured.",5
1012,It's quite sore and I can see it from the side. What is it and can it be fixed promptly?,5
1018,I am 5 days post op and I feel the swelling goes down a little bit each day. But when it does swell it alternates where one side swells shut and then it decreases and the other side swells shut. I am wondering if that is common at this stage of the recovery. I thought I would be swollen at all times but that doesn't seem to be the case. It's like the turbinates take turns blocking off my nose one side at a time.,5
1019,"Hello One week ago, I had septoplasty to unblock the right side of my nose. While searching for the reason behind my asymmetrical eyes - The right eyeball has been always sunken -, I found out that silent sinus syndrome could be the reason behind it. I am planning to diagnose SSS with an ENT. But my question is: If I have SSS, could the septoplasty surgery I had one week ago improve my asymmetrical eye in the long run, or should I expect other proceeders? Thank you",5
1033,"I have a deviated septum that bends my nose to one side and changes the appearance of my face when looking from either the left or right side. The middle portion of my nose is bent so the tip of my nose is bent to my right and my nose looks weird. Also, I cannot breathe very well from one nostril.",5
1037,I had my surgery in July. 3 days after the surgery the one of the splints fell out. When I lay on either side to go to sleep I have a very uncomfortable throbbing sensation in my nose it almost feels like someone is pulling it and the right side closes off. I mentioned this twice to my surgeon but he brushed it off and made me feel like I was being silly. Is this still part of the healing process? Do I need a second opinion? It's very uncomfortable and affects my sleep.,5
1062,I have a deviated septum that has blocked my left nostril and makes it extremely difficult to breathe out of. The septum seems to really be pushing to the left side in my case. Could a standard Septoplasty surgery help correct this? Is this part of a deviated septum?,5
1066,So the side of my nose that was once always hampered by the septal deviation is open. The other side however is slightly congested now. On this now congested side my ENT also did a slight turibinectomy. On the day that I took my splints out I felt like superman and had equal airflow from both sides but after 3 days the turbinectomy side became congested. It is day 15 now after my surgery and it is still slightly congested. Is this normal and when should I expect this to clear up if at all?,5
1086,"I understand the procedure is not cosmetic but I feel like this could be an exception. My septum protrudes at the bottom of my right nostril, giving the appearance of it being much smaller than the left. Will septoplasty aid in fixing this to a degree (getting rid of the protruding septum)",5
1087,"I had a septoplasty about 2 weeks ago and when when I seep on my side I feel the tip of my nose drag down ever so slightly and I feel pressure because of this. If I sleep on my either my left or right I can feel the slightest amount of pressure because of gravity being exerted from the front of my nose. Is this normal and will everything stiffen up in time, if so how long should it take?",5
1090,I m asking this because my nose is asymmetric and the septum determines when the cartilage create the angle between the side and the dorsum. Is it possible?,5
1100,"I am very worried that I'll need surgery again, sometimes I can't breathe from my right or left nostril and when I check why there's this small round thing that just shifts places from left to right. Like I said, the bone bridge seems to be bent to the left side of my nose making it look crooked. At times I can breathe perfectly but other times I can't. What are the odds that I'll need surgery again? If not what will the doctor do to fix my problem?",5
1104,"I had septoplasty 6 weeks ago now. My breathing difficulty at night has gone and i sleep relatively peacefully however the left nostril (which the doctor operated through) seems to feel constricted, something which i did not feel prior to surgery. The doctor said left side will take longer to heal and i was just concerned if by 6 weeks this should have sorted out? I can see the left side is much constricted than the right when i look in the mirror. Is this normal?",5
1105,I am 4 weeks post-Septoplasty. The right side of my septum used to be quite convex. yesterday I accidentally pushed the tip of my nose to the right side but I had no considerable pain after that and no bleeding. I have no access to my surgeon. I wonder If there is a need for me to be visited by an ENT doctor. Thanks,5
1111,"I always had troubles breathing from my nose one of my nostrils is always closed so I only breathe from one side, its very hard to sleep and when i was a child i had horrible nose bleeds, not to long ago I suffer for very bad nose bleed, I always feel pressure in my sinuses and my breathing drops below normal during sleep and I had this a sleep study done as well. Is this the root of the problem? thank you!",5
1113,"Septoplasty has failed twice. It was originally deviated to the right, and after the surgery deviated to the left. Also, part of the cartilage in my nose had collapsed, so I went back in for a second surgery to get the grafting to my nose, and another septoplasty. It has once again failed, and I cannot blame it on swelling, because it has been a year since my second surgery. If there is such a high success rate, why am I breathing 95% in one nostril and 5% in the other?",5
1127,I fell from roof about 8 months ago and got hit on the left side of the nose and almost at the center of the nose...now I have a deviated septum and this deviation is caused by the bones which hits with the ground ...like by hitting on left side the bones moves inward towards center and bends the septum .... I require a septoplasty or a rhinoplasty or some kind of minor operation without damaging the septum and which recovers only my broken bone from top and correct septum automatically ?,5
1130,I sustained an injury to my nose and thought it would be fine because there was no bleeding only swelling and tenderness but now after two months I feel a pressure on the bridge of my nose and can't breathe through my right nostril when I lay down on my side and also experience headaches if I don't elevate my head. What could this be?,5
1140,"I've injured my nose more than a few times in my life, but haven't officially broken it. It didn't use to be crooked, and it seems as if it's getting worse. I've also noticed that it's hard to breathe through one side of my nose if I'm congested or stuffy. What is causing this? What can I do to fix it? It's not painful but very uncomfortable and looks terrible. Is septoplasty right for me?",5
1151,"A toddler threw an iphone at my face years ago, and after finally seeing an ENT, he said that I needed to have a septoplasty. I had a septoplasty a couple months ago, and while my breathing is slightly better, my nose is uneven. The right side protrudes while the left side slants in. There is also something that feels like bone blocking the airway on the left side. When I stick my finger up it, I always hit this bone. Do I need a septoplasty or can it be fixed without surgery?",5
1153,"I have had several cases of trauma to my nose. I'm 20 years old and experience SO MANY variations in my breathing. When I inhale, sometimes one collapses, sometimes both collapse. Sometimes it physically hurts and crumples when I breathe in. Sometimes the right nostril will be blocked all day, other times it will randomly open up but then the left side is painfully blocked. As a child they were wide open 24/7 even when I lied down. What gives? :( Can manipulating/picking my nose influence this?",5
1157,"I had a septoplasty two weeks ago, and my nose seems to have a dent on the left side. Also, the tip is crooked and bigger on the left side. The middle bone is leaning towards the right side so much, and I can even feel it. Is this going to change, especially the middle bone since there isn't much swelling on the top, but the bone is leaning so much to the right",5

The grafts are placed very high over the cartilage existing on sides of the nose) I still have collapse when I inhale. Also feel resistance high up in my passages. Difficult to clean out other than with saline rinses. The passages are so narrow even a q-tip rubs on both sides trying to get it thru.",5
1186,I was doing quite fine but since yesterday i m experiencing pressure in my cheeks straight to my ear on the side of the procedure. Is this normal? Hearing is not effected. Breathing is not normal yet.,5
1189,"I got a septoplasty done Tuesday and it is now Friday. On Wednesday he took out the packing, and for a little bit after I could breath but now one nostril is completely clogged and the other one is mostly clogged. Also I've been doing the neilmed sinus rinse and it only comes out of the same nostril or my throat, not the other side. I know it says it takes like 2-4 weeks to be 100%, are these symptoms normal? My doctor is out of town so my next follow up isn't for 9 more days.",5
1192,I had those surgeries over a year ago and I still have difficulty breathing and whistling in my nose congestion etc. and I can feel my septum is almost closed on the left but that is usually the only side I can breathe from what could be causing this?,5

One, i noticed when i clean it with the qtip it makes the bleeding worse on my left side . is this normal? also, yesterday i noticed a bump on the outside of my right nostril and want to know what that could be caused by and will it go away? it wasn' there before the surgery?",5
1215,I'm having a septoplasty with RF turbinate reduction next week. I am thinking about removing the hump on my nose too. Will they be able to remove my hump without breaking the bone? The hump looks bigger from the left side because the bone on the right side of my nose is a little bit thicker.,5
1217,"I had a septoplasty 2 weeks ago today to straighten it out and help with my breathing, yet when i look up my nose now the septum still looks deviated to the right hand side and the nostril still looks closed off compared to the left; is this normal after two weeks and will this change? My nose still feels blocked and cant breath clearly through it.",5
1230,"I was involved in a bike accident and had a surgery done to straighten out my septum. After the surgery, the doctor said my nose was badly broken but that he got my septum completely straight. A year post op, in pictures especially, it does not look like my nose is straight. My left nostril is bigger (and stays big, even when I inhale sharply through my nose) and it appears as though one side of the nose is bigger. Is this swelling or a deviated septum?",5
1233,3 1/3 weeks ago I went under for a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates. My doctor told me everything would be find but I have had the worst recovery. After my splint removal my left nostril has been enlarged and has crusty stuff stuck on it that I can't get out. Now my right side is getting like that. Today I did my nasal irrigation and when I did my right nostril this overwhleming sent of alcohol rushed through my nose and my mouth. I was gagging cause the smell was so bad. Is this normal?,5
1241,"I haven't had any nosebleeds, I am congested a lot, sometimes one nostril is more clogged then the other or some days there both fine. I don't have any post-nasal drips or headaches, I don't really have any signs of one besides one nostril is bigger then the other and that I'm congested a lot but I have allergies to so idk which is which. I tired looking in my nose I mean it looks straight still but idk for sure. I think I could have a mild one.",5
1242,I just got a septoplasty done 5 days ago and i went to go pull some dry blood near the edge of my left nostril and i may have pulled on a suture. The incision looks reopened on the left cause i can clearly see it open and close as i move my nose.,5
1266,"So, my follow up went well today. My surgeon used no stents and he used the absorb-able gel in my nose instead of traditional packing. But as I went to clean my nose and take a peek for myself after I sneezed and had an odd tugging sensation, my left nostril has a dark red strip of open flesh on the side of the septum that is not visible on the right side, its obvious this is where an incision was made, that side just looks like normal flesh. No fluid bleeding.... Should I be concerned?",5
1268,"I just had septoplasty and I know the you get a split in each side of the nose, I can only visibly see one of the splints, on my right side, on the left side I cant see anything. Is this normal? is it possible I may have pushed it in further unintentionally when I slept or something like that?",5
1280,I had a septoplasty on my left nostril 2 weeks ago and now I can't breath at all on my right nostril. Is it possible the doctor missed seeing there was a problem on both my nostrils before the surgery? Or is the swelling on the opposite nostril normal so soon post-op? I need to mention I also had a nasal hump removed during the operation. Thank you!,5
1306,"I am having a septoplasty soon, which I understand will not fix the uneven lower lateral cartilage on one side of my nose. I do not want to touch the bridge of my nose at all. I just want to reduce one side. Is that possible? What is the cost and what would it entail?",5

1356,"I recently had a septoplasty/turbinate reduction about 2.5 weeks ago. I noticed: 1. My right nostril is 100% open, no problem. My left the lower inferior turbinate looks fine but when I look up my nose it appears the top of the opening in my nose is blocked. I can see the skin touching the middle septal wall. Is it too soon to assume the turbinate reduction did not get high enough or will this take more time ? 2. When I take up in the morning, both nostrils and my throat are very dry. Thanks !",5
1357,"Hi. So I have a very deviated septum, an ENT checked it out and im going to get my septum straightend for free because of my breathing problem (its completley blocked), I also get easy nosebleeds in the nosetrill that isnt blocked. Right now my septum is crooked to the left of me. My nose wing cartilage also appear to be bigger on my left side compared to my right, its alot bigger. My guess is that the septum is pushing to the left and making it appear bigger. Also my nosetrills is very uneven.",5
1371,"Hello, I had a rhino+septoplasty performed together some years ago. After surgery, the cartilage that protruded slightly at the base of one nostril was gone. However, it wasn't for years that I realised my nose breathing hadn't improved. I took another look and saw that further in r-nostril at mid-top level, there is what appears to be proturbing cartilage on the septal side. Shouldn't this op be performed on both sides? Doc would have seen this. I feel confused and disappointed.",5
1397,"I have a nose job and septoplasty done about 7 months ago. Lately, I have noticed that when I breathe in, my left nostril hardly moves while my right nostril almost fully collapses inward. Why might this be occurring? I am going back to see my plastic surgeon this week about a bump that may require revision surgery, should I mention this as well?",5
1399,"Hello, My right nasal passageway was blocked from a sports accident years ago. I had deviated septum surgery 3 weeks ago. While it has improved slightly, I am still having issues breathing from that nasal passage. I have a wheezing sound and when I close up the left nasal passage (good side) it feels like I am breathing out of a straw. Does it sound like the surgery was partially successful? Will I need to go in again to correct it?",5
1400,It is the 3rd day after my seotopjasty operation. When I sneezed with my mouth open on my right nostril all the mucus and blood came out also I am able to now breathe through the right one. Is it normal for me on the 3rd day that I am now slowly able to breath through the nostril and I have blown my nose a few times should I stop blowing. Another question is that will anything happen to my nose if I laugh such as the nose shape changing or stitches coming off.,5
1418,"When I lay on either shoulder, the opposite nostril opens and I can breath. Sometimes I can feel the shift in my nose. To memory I have never been able to breath easily through both at the same time. Is this a deviated/ swollen septum or something els? My nose appears straight from outside.",5
1420,"I have very narrow breathing passages, particularly on that left side and nasal valve collapse. I have two questions. As he will do the limited septoplasty and turbinate reduction on the left side, will he only put the splints and the packing on the left side too? Second: I had a septoplasty and turbinate resection in 2001, but obviously it didn't work long term. Why does this happen?",5

My right side feels a lot of pressure, like it is pulling upwards and my lip is a bit higher on the right side. Like something is pulling me entire cheek towards the top right side of my head.

I find it really hard to sleep also when breathing because of how wet and runny the nose is getting so I just put a piece of tissue in each nostril to dry it, will this effect it any different ? Also the actual septum is still wonky and not stmetrical will this change as it heals?",5
1445,"Hi, my skin has come away from the visible piece of septum on one side under the tip of my nose. It's not visble at all unless you pull it to the other side and I can breathe fine. However it does irritate me as it can become slightly stuck and crusty so I have to push it to dislodge it. It also worries me that it could get worse. I've looked up Divated septum and I'm pretty sure it isn't that as my septum looks straight, it's just the skins come away on one side. Thanks in advance for any reply",5
1447,"The nasal turbinates on my deviated side is small, and the turbinates on the open side is large. My doctor said that this is because the body naturally tries to normalize breathing. He also said that if I decided not to get the turbinates reduced during surgery, that the turbinates would adjust again in size to normalize breathing. Is this true? Is there any idea of how long it would take for the turbinates to adjust to the equal spacing of my nostrils after a septoplasty naturally?",5

As I have gotten older it has became very noticeable when looking at my nose. My right nostril is much higher than the left when looking straight at it, and when looking beneath my nose you can see the septum sticks out of my left nostril. If you feel inside my nose you can feel the septum curving out to make it stick out at the left. What can I get done to fix this problem?",5

It doesn't bother me much during the day, but at night, if I sleep on the deviated side, that side gets noticeably clogged. My ENT doctor recommends I get a septoplasty done. He said he would remove the cartilage& bone that is deviated. To me it looks like a lot of bone & cartilage to remove. Will my nose be weaker after this? Are there any other options or recommendations?",5
1480,I broke my septum when I was little. Now I have a deviated septum. It is hard for me to breathe out of my left nostril most of the time.

The only time that this congestion goes away is in when my heart rate goes up. One nostril will be completely congested, and I will simply jump up and down a few times and it instantly goes away. Immediately after I stop jumping, it comes back. The same goes for something like a presentation at school. Is this normal?",5

1742,I mentioned the bump on the right side of my nose and also the fact that I still can not get air on the same side. He told me the right side is still very very swollen and my nose valve when I breathe in seems to shut. So I can breathe out .. but not in without my nose closing. When I go back he is going to see if any swelling went down and if not .. he is going to have to surgically open my nose valve. How bad is this surgery? Ive attached a pic of the bump on the right side.,5

1760,"Great airflow in right side of nose and partial obstruction in left side. I looked in the left nostril and saw a focal bulge of the septum about 1 cm back which I think is causing the partial obstruction. It looks like it's at the suture line and has a little clot on it - after I sinus rinsed, the clot came off and it looked blue-gray and shiny (small amount of exposed cartilage?). Likely to require revision surgery, and if so, when to do it, and how big a surgery?",5

I think I would rather have it straightened and pushed back to the middle instead of having it removed, because removing it is not natural and wouldn't removing even a small part risk the structure of my nose collaping/messing up the shape of my nose? Also, I was not born with a deviated septum....I got it from an injury. So the cartilage will not bend back or shift again, right? It's been deviated for a year now.",5

1826,I had a septoplasty in June 2013 and then a valve repair in January 2014. The valve repair was due to a small bump on the right side of my nose which did not lay properly with the cartridge graft. Now there is a lump on the right side of the bridge of my nose. The bump has not changed for 9 months and still hurts to press on. I have been to my doctor three times about this and he has nothing to say other than it can take up to a year for swelling to decrease. It is painful and very unattractive.,5

When I looked at the results from the new cat scan you can see that my caudal is not on the midline. So he trimmed it instead of resetting it. When I brought this up to him he said that you can't always get the septum straight and the important thing is that it looks better than before.

	I had septoplasty &amp; rhinoplasty almost a year ago. Since then my RT nostril is always congested. Consulted w/my Dr &amp; he gave me Flonase &amp; said I was still swollen on my RT side. I get relief at times when I'm lying on my LT side &amp; can feel the congestion shift to the LT but not always. I had the surgery done to repair a deviated septum on my left nostril, but now 85% of the time I can't breathe through my RT nostril. What could this be a result of? I have a follw up in a few weeks. Suggestions?

2155,"I may have breathing issues but im not sure as it is normal to breathe through one nostril at a time. I think I only have symptoms when I have a cold. In the night my nose gets blocked making breathing difficult, so I have to breathe using my mouth which makes my throat sore. The left side of my nose is bigger as the bone I think is called the lateral nasal cartilage is enlarged. Could this be caused by a deviated septum? If not, what has caused this deformity?",5

	I injured my left cheekbone three years ago and currently waiting on further investigation. My septum seems to be deviating increasingly to the right of late. Would the injury to the cheekbone have caused this (it was likely a fracture)..it seems a lot more crooked than it was before the accident. I am 28 and am having a lot of sinus issues and worried.

	Hello, i generally always find it very hard to breath through my nose, especially the left nostril, so I generally only breathe through my mouth. I'm also getting eye pressure problems/headache/migraines the eye doctor reckons its sinus problems (maybe insufficient airflow coz I generally only breathe through my mouth?). The MRI shows the left air passageway to be very narrow and sort of bent half way down. Is this normal would surgery be recommended or beneficial?

	I am scheduled for septoplasty next month. I can't breathe out of my right nostril. One of the doctors thinks that it's because of a growth spur but once I told him I broke my nose at a young age he didn't have a correct answer. **My nose actually broke when I was 8 along with my two front teeth and my nose healed crooked causing it to block my right nostril** Will the surgeons fix my cartilage bone which was broken and now crooked or no? I am pretty sure I have no growth spur.

	Hello, I had a Septoplasty done 3 months ago. Yesterday, I bumped my nose with my notebook computer and had a one minute brief episode of pain and numbing of the teeth. Being paranoid, I thought I may have ruined the surgery. My left nostril is more congested (not sure if this is due to the nasal cycle) and when I use my fingers to feel the septum, it feels more convex on the left and is moveable in the sense that I can take away the convexity. Should I be concerned with this? Thank you! Chris

	I had a septoplasty last tuesday because I had a deviated septum (right side was slightly blocked). It's been 7 days now, and my left side I can breathe in and out very well, however, my right side is completely blocked. I actually think they've made a possible mistake and pushed my bone to the right (the wrong side) because I cannot literally breath at all with my right side. If I try hard, I can squeeze a very little nasal air out of my right side, but nothing in. Is all this what to expect?

	The reason I had this done was to cure my breathing problems. I could never breathe out of my right nostril too well so my ENT performed the surgery. After 3 months i still cannot breathe well at all out of my right nostril. It is like there is permanent swelling. If you try to blow your nose it's just dry, annoying nothing. Surgery didn't help at all and I spent 3 nights in the ER after my surgery due to bleeding. Eventually they electro cauterized it and now I have an infection. Please help.

	My septum has deviated over the last 2 years not to the right or left, but outwards. It has caused me to be congested and have difficulty breathing every single day. It is clearly out of alignment to the point where breathing through my nose is very hard to do, not like it was just a couple years ago.

It appears that there is now a small protrusion from my septum, it's just a small piece of skin that doesn't appear to attach to anything. This was not there prior to surgery.

	While I'm sure the deviation of the actual septum was addressed internally, my nose still points to my right. Expectation was made clear that this would be addressed.
