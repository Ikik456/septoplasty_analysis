7,"I had my surgery over a year ago. 1 month post op I started getting some really bad headaches. The ent assured me it was not related to surgery. Fast forward to two weeks ago, They are so unbearable and last for days. My mri came back I have an obstructed nasal cavity. When I looked at the scans myself I also noticed there is some kind of label on my bone. If I get this corrected will these headaches go away? Is this bone label a foreign object?? Im freaking out.",0
50,"My nurse said theyll be removed in 12 days at my preop but i read online and it says you should take it out in 1-3 days to minimize risk of infection. Which is true? Also, if I keep it in do I use nasal saline spray with the packing in my nose? Kind of confused.",0
137,"Two days post op my doctor removed my splints, now i'm a week and a half post op, and there is cartilage dangling in my nose obstructing my nasal pathway. Did my doctor remove my splints too soon?",0

191,"Hi, My Septoplasty and Turbinate reduction took place 10 days ago. Since then it feels like its been complication after complication. So far there's been: Perforated Septum during surgery (sutured at the time), Hematoma a week later, Headaches and sore throat from cold dry air. Partial collapse of right nostril yesterday. Should I be concerned that so much seems to be going wrong? Thanks in advance!",0
197,"Hi doctor, thank you for your time. I had septoplasty and outfracture of inferior turbinates 8 weeks, 2 days ago. I saw my consultant 2 days ago, where i was told its healing nice, septum is straight but may have blockage of sinuses. So currently using nasonex once a day. My question is, whilst changing my little boy tonight, he flapped his arms back an hit me straight in the nose, sounded like a clicking sound, didnt really hurt an was no bleeding....just paranoia. Would this have done damage",0
227,I had a septoplasty exactly one month before along with some treatment for allergy for turbinates. Now I would like to have alcohol with 2 days in party. Is it okay if I drink or I shouldn't drink. Still I feel pain Inside my nostrils and nothing can be seen as an opera injury. Pls advice,0
228,"How many options exist for septoplasty stents &amp; why aren't there better and more tolerable choices for patients? I wish I had done more research on this prior to my septoplasty. I just had the stents removed today -- my experience was horrific, and I did not tolerate them well. There were times I felt like I would have a panic attack from the extreme discomfort. I was miserable 24/7. My surgeon claims the stents are advanced state-of-the-art but as the patient, they were barbaric and painful.",0
235,It's been 7 days since I had my septoplasty surgery done. I went in today for my follow up appointment to get packing removed. My nose bled uncontrollably after packing was removed. I sat at the doctors office bleeding for about 40 minutes. The nurse that removed packing said in order to stop bleeding ahead needed to burn the blood vessel. What she did worked! I'm a little concerned because the pain I'm feeling now is worse than when I walked in. Is it normal to bleed a lot after packing is removed?,0
255,Hi im 7 days post op and in 4 days my doc is going to take off the stitches and the splints Today i realised a thick metal stitch coming out of the septum and hitting the nose skin. My question is should i wait 4 days until i go to dr office? And also can a big stitch like that cause septal perforation afterwards? Thank you,0
259,I had a septoplasty done 6 days ago and got the stitches out today. Ive had a horrible odor in my nose for the past 3 days and it seems to be getting worse. I thought when he took the stitches and packers out it would smell better but its way worse now. Is this bad? When will the smell go away?,0
281,"it feels as if something has been stuck there for months. Is it possible that a stitch is stuck? stitches were removed, however, some were missed and stayed in for about 2 weeks after they were first removed.",0
284,I went to my 2 wk post op and everything seemed good. The dr sucked a lot of mucus out and said everything looks like its healing good. Well I blew my nose tonight (I thought this was fine being almost 30 days po) & now I have a stitch hanging a half inch out of my left nostril. At&nbsp;first I thought it was a booger and pulled on it with tissue. I tugged gently and it is still connected somewhere deep in my nose. Should I cut it? I have no bleeding from tugging on it. What should I do?,0
301,"I had septoplasty surgery 3 days ago and now inside of my nose look horrible, do I&nbsp;need to rinse it?&nbsp;",0
306,"Two weeks ago I had septoplasty and one week later I had the stents removed. At the time my surgeon told me to not blow or touch my nose; no cleaning instruction were given. The congestion comes and goes and alternates between nostrils. The cold air makes my sinuses feel really cold. The person/numbness in my teeth and roof of mouth comes and goes as well. Is this normal? As well, I'm a smoker, I've cut back to 10-15 smokes a day, does this increase chances of infection? Is so what should I look out for?",0
316,I had a septoplasty with turbinate reduction 2 weeks ago. Tonight I've developed some pain inside my nose and the occasional itching and irritated feeling on both the inside of my nose and right around the outside of my nostrils. Should I be concerned?

329,"I had septoplasty 2 months ago, and there seems to be phlegm at the back of my throat (or the left nose of which I had incision) constantly and is very uncomfortable. Nasal rinse and guaifenesin won't work. Is this normal process of healing? Thank You!",0
332,"I had a scar band removed from one side of nose. Doctor put in 2 splints sewing them in to both sides of my nose and told my family that they would be removed in 4 to 6 weeks. Why so long, it seems crazy to leave them in so long.",0

357,It has been 4 weeks since I had sinus surgery and a septoplasty. I have been doing nasal rinses with neilmed 4 times a day and am still on flixonase nasule drops. In the past few days I have been getting bad headaches behind eyes and pain when bending over along with yellow discharge down back of my throat. I dont think its infected as have no other symptoms such as bad smell or fever. Is this normal? Is it likely to be infection? Should I still be getting sinus headaches now? Thanks,0
363,"Hello! I recently got a septoplasty with turbinate reduction, and am currently one week post-op. My doctor has told me that the plastic splints will be removed three weeks post-op. I am just curious as to how common of a practice this is? From what I can find, one week is the most typical, and I can't find any information on leaving them in longer. My physician has said that this is how they always perform the procedure. I had packing which was removed two days post-op. Thank you!",0
375,"No instruction before/after surgery.I suffer from extreme bilateral TN2 so i was concerned about pain.Insane pain cracking all the way to my ears.When it was over, drove myself to pharmacy then home (about hour and half).For days a water type substance fills paper towel when bent over and I have chunks of silicone type in stool.

I have another apt at the 3 week mark but its got my worried in the meantime.",0
388,"I have had no issues with my sinuses till about two weeks ago. I've started getting sharp pain on the left side of my face (where the concha bullosa was) where the sinuses are located, as well as some eye swelling.

405,"I had a septoplasty plus cleaning of my sinus about 2 months ago. I moved out of state (away from my ENT) to a place with very limited health care and started having issues. I have green/yellow snot that smells like something is dying up my nose. Also one side of my face is swollen and I'm in a lot of pain. I get dizzy and lightheaded very easily now, I'm very nauseas, and there is an intense sting in my head whenever I stand up. This has been going on for about a week now.",0
421,I had a septoplasty 15 days ago. I have less air flow now and I can feel that my septum isn't straight inside my nose... It feels like the deviation is now higher up then it was prior to surgery. Did my septoplasty fail?,0
424,"I recently had surgery 5 days ago. On the fourth day I started to become dizzy. Well more of a light headed kind of feeling. I am not sure if I attribute this to the dried up blood in my nose. I also realized I have a small lump feeling when I swallow. I am getting my splints removed in two days. Would that fix my problem? Or is the problem associated with my inner ear? I have been using saline for my post op care. Thanks,",0
425,I can breathe so much better but I am worried I may have done damage? No blood. The mucus was a clear with some brown very thick sticky mass. The thickest I have ever experienced. . I can breathe better and might be being paranoid but I wonder if my nostril looks a tad larger. Was the mucus a normal part of the healing process that I shouldn't have removed or am I okay?,0

440,I got a septoplasty 7 days ago tomorrow and on day 5 one stitch came out close to the nostril during a saline rinse. When I looked in my nose with the flashlight of my phone to check for blood I saw a gaping hole in the wall of my nose. When I breathe in I can feel air going through it. I called ER/ dr on call (weekend) and nobody seems concerned. This is definitely a dark hole with defined edges. What are the chances this is just the incsion that opened and not a perforated septum?,0
490,I had a septoplasty and this is my 10th day post op. I have had some crusting buildup inside my nose lately. Can I use a Cotton Bud to remove them by my self? What I was thinking was to dip them in h2o2 and apply it in the crustings. Is this advisable?,0
492,"I had Septoplasty 10 weeks ago, to correct a septal spur. I had a huge amount of pain for mnths leading up to the operation and breathing was restricted on one side of my nose.

	My healing process seems generally in line with the usual experience. However last night I took a peak into my right nostril and noticed a white circle the size of an eraser butt-end about an inch and a half into my nasal cavity. I understand this is where the incision is usually performed during septoplasty - so I'm not sure if I should have a cause for concern. I did however notice a stitch fell out around the 5-day mark. There is no excessive bleeding.

	I recently had a septoplasty. The swelling, pain is reduced however my left Nostril is bleeding constantly, lets say 1 drop of blood in every 2o min. This can be normal but I am having a feeling of flue. My right nostril is discharging flue fluids and no sign of bLood. its pure fluids and they are going down my throat too. Is this normal with Septoplasty that i have caught flue or i actually got flue out of no where. What should I do. My both noses are like crushed with some heavy punch.

	So i have had a fairly loud constant ringing in both ears since getting Septoplasty 3 and a half weeks ago. This ringing is getting louder and louder. The only time i have ever had a ringing this loud was before I had wax removed from one of my ears. There was pain yesterday for about 2 minutes in one of them. I am seeing the doctor again for a follow up in about a week but am worried this is permanent. Could this cause permanent damage?

	It's been almost exactly 4 weeks after I had tubular reduction and deviated septum repair. Inside my nose, right above where the stitch was on each side I have white things poking out of my septum. They look like plastic, kind of and have become more visible over the last few days. Is this normal? Is something coming undone? What are these things?

	Hi, I had a septoplasty 17 days ago. From what I understand should have been a pretty minor septoplasty. I do not feel anymore scabbing or soreness (very slight). There is constant whistling and hissing through the nostril that was closed before. It makes it very hard to get a good night sleep and wakes my wife. Although I am not too congested nasal decongestant spray helps (sinex). I cannot use sinex more than a couple days at a time. So would a steroid spray be helpful? Is this normal?

	I am 2 weeks post-op from septorhinoplasty, bilateral turbinate reduction and adenoidectomy and I've had this pain in my throat below my ears ever since surgery but it has only gotten more painful as I swallow. I know it is still early as I am only 2 weeks post-op but I am just wondering when I can start to expect that pain to subside. Also, which procedure is it related to? Thank you

	I have had a septoplasty &amp; turbinate reduction 100 days ago , I started noticing recently unilateral nasal obstruction (left). 1. Worst when lying on my left side. 2. better when using nasal spays (anti histamine, alpha blockers) 3. Better when walking around. my post op appointment exam showed a non dissolving septal stitch that was removed but everything else was OK. I need a second opinion , I am really bothered and I have stopped using all sprays about a month ago. Thank you

	I have excruciating pain at the base of my nose. In the area of my septal spine I feel pressure and throbbing as well as stabbing pain. I was told today that the best cause for all of my symptoms was a migraine. I believe it is complication from a previous surgery where half of my septal spine was removed. It is pain very different from any migraine I have ever had. I have gotten migraines my entire life. Something feels really wrong about that theory to me. Thank you in advance for your time.

	I had elective septoplasty and outfracture of inferior turbinates 9 days ago. I was told to stop physical exercise for two weeks. When I have my next weekly lesson it will have been11 days since the surgery. Other than feeling fatigued for the first few days my nose feels good. I want to do what is best for my recovery, but I hate sitting about not doing anything and I'm itching to start my tennis and daily weight-lifting sessions.

	Today was my first post-op appt after septorhinoplasty. The splint was taken off and stitches removed. The whole process was rather uncomfortable as instruments and medicine swabs were stuffed WAY up my nose!

	Had septoplasty and turbinate reduction eight days ago. It&#39;s healing nicely, I think. But since dried mucus came out earlier, feels cold, runny and tingly? Like it&#39;s seeping but its not seeping. Is this normal? Also, now I can, am I allowed to breath through nose? It expands the outer rims and makes bubbling sound when I do but doesn&#39;t hurt? Also bridge of nose aches, is this normal?? And what is a turbinate reduction even?! I only knew about the septoplasty till the surgeon said he&#39;d done it!

	Hello, I had septoplasty surgery on Friday July 8th. I had mucus and blood coming out of my nose for about 3 days and it stopped. Now I have a bunch of dried mucus blood in my nostrils. 5 days after surgery I was picking at the dried blood/mucus to clear up my nostrils and I accidentally pulled out some sutures that were attached to one of the solidified blood/mucus I had in there. I did feel it when it came out, but otherwise it does not hurt and I am not bleeding. Is this a problem?please help

	3 weeks ago I had Septoplasty, I had packing removed 1 week after, and 2 weeks after I had exam and it was all OK, I can breath much better now. What im worried about I&#39;m still having dark red, really thick mucus (almost looks like membrane) coming through mouth mostly every couple days, until mucus comes out it feels like sinus is blocked, when it comes out it feels perfectly fine. Is that normal and if there is something I should do about that or it is something I should be worried about?
