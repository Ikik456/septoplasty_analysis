2,"March 10th of 2021 I had Septoplasty with Turbinate Reduction of my middle turbinate's (he removed 40-50% each) and small reduction of inferior (less than 10%). I have seen 2 doctors since the surgery both say I would not have removed that much of the middle turbinate but you do not have Empty Nose Syndrome. But I still feel way too much cold air that hits my throat on one side and other is still deviated. I am now dizzy alot and have no idea what do next, it ruined my life !",4
6,"First of all, I'm not really sure that a septoplasty is what I need, but RealSelf doesn't have a general or other category. I have been dealing with a mystery for about a year and a half now. I've seen 12 different doctors and none of them can figure out why my nose randomly swells up and gets red for anywhere between 5 mins and 2 hours everyday. At one point they thought I had carcinoid syndrome but a urine test ruled it out. I'm at my wit's end.",4
8,I have deviated septum which really bothers me as I cannot breathe properly; and droopy nose. I have a hump too but it does not bother me at all. I went to see a doctor and he said he has to correct the hump as well and it's not possible to do surgery without fixing all together. I honestly don't want to lose my hump as it's not a problem. I'm planning to see other doctors; but can someone advise me whether I can just have tip+cartilage surgery only?,4
12,"I have a deviated septum. I am worried my plastic surgeon will tell me he can't guarantee my nostrils will be symmetrical but that he'll make it better. I want to know what my expectations should be and if he says he can't make them symmetrical, if I should pursue the surgery with another doctor.",4
14,My left turbinate has been swollen shut since my septorhinoplasty 10 months ago. I reached out to my surgeon and he prescribed me a nasal steroid spray. It did nothing. Went back 2 more times he told me its allergies. Got a second opinion and got lucky and got a same day appointment cause someone canceled but unfortunately that morning (before I called) I used a decongestant spray so the doctor literally did not believe that it was swollen. (No I do not use the spray often hardly once a month),4
29,I was in an RTA when i was young. Around 2010 i underwent nose surgery to allow me to breath through my nose properly. Around 2013 i underwent further surgery on my nose re appearance. Image is what i have now. Is there anything i can do for more straighyer appearance/to fill that small area where the bend is highlighted?,4
31,"Hello, I had a deviated septum which caused breathing problems. I saw an ent in Toronto and he performed a septoplasty and also burned my adenoids which were an unusual size for my age (at the time 24). He failed to mention I had a perforated septum, and since then Ive been trying to find a doctor who will fix it. The hole has gotten bigger; its painful, and loud. Ive seen ents who essentially refuses to fix it because of the success rate but I need it fixed. I also have chronic sinisitus.",4
34,"I see that it is bad, but can it be fixed and how risky is it to have revision septoplasty cause i wouldnt want this to happened again.",4
35,"I have been to an ent who sent me to have a cat scan. I cant breathe well out of one nostril and I have pain on the sides of my nose. He confirmed that I have collapsed nasal valves but had me get a ct scan to see if there were other issues. By looking at these photos, can anyone please tell me if I have a deviated septum or something else going on?",4
40,"I know I have a septal deviation, what's bothering me is the deformity caused by the dislocated medial crus (colored in red), which is overextended and has a resting angle perpendicular to my septum rather than beside it. It's extremely physically uncomfortable, distracting and sometimes even painful. I've searched years for information on this deformity but have found nothing. Is it really that rare or is my physical discomfort simply not considered a medical issue? What can be done about it?",4
47,About one and a half years ago I had a rhino-septoplasty. Now my nostrils are still closing when I breathe. Is it likely to happen again after a 2nd septoplasty? The photos are of me breathing in and breathing out.,4
61,"At this size it seems like it can be done through a closed/endoscopic procedure with an ear cartilage donor graft and elevating the nasal mucosa off of the nasal floor and/or turbinates to cover it up. I realize the ear cartilage graft won't grow back. But if a provider is elevating some of the nasal mucosa off of the turbinates to use to close things does the body eventually heal that as well? As a layman, it kind of sounds like it's stripping tissue off the turbinate.",4
66,I have a perforation in my nasal septum that is 2cm and I also have a deviated septum. I found a doctor who is very experienced with closing perforations this size. He is an ENT and double board certified plastic surgeon. I wanted to ask if he could do a bullhorn lip lift at the same time to reduce the distance between my nose and lip and correct some asymmetry. What are the possible risks of having these two procedures done at the same time so I am informed?,4
67,If it better to do both at the same time or do the septoplasty first so the surgeon can focus on thing separately. Also in general is a reconstructive surgeon better equipped for these types of surgery compared to a plastic surgeon?,4
70,"I know I have a perforation&mdash;I want to know what it could be that there is something that slides back and forth within the perforation. I feel it when I am clearing my nose with a Q-tip because my nose is dry and unable to blow my nose. I have sjgren's syndrome, and it is difficult clearing my nose, and I know I must have caused damage. I also used steroid sprays because of chronic congestion and the need to clear my nose because I have to use a bi-pap machine for chronic obstructive apnea.",4
75,Im looking to fix my nose. Ive been having breathing problems and anxiety over it . I have not met anyone in an office yet . But Im going to try a ent doctor and try to fix the problem .,4
78,I been told I have to stop using my nasal spray for 3 weeks before I can have Turbinate reduction surgery.Dr gave me Prescription steroid nasal spray it didnt work the first night I was breathing through my mouth it made my mouth so dry my tongue felt like sandpaper I couldnt sleep it felt like was Suffocating there is no way I can go 3 weeks with out using my nasal spray,4
85,"Can you please explain: If turbinates are lined with tissue that expand and contract, the same as erectile tissue, how is it that cutting and surgery to this area which causes scarring would not cause pain when the turbinates try to resume their job of the nasal cycle of expanding/ contracting and or congestion when needing to?",4
87,"I had a consultation with a doctor saying he would only repair it on one side and no added grafts. What answer should a surgeon give me about this procedure, to make sure he has a good technique? Thank you!",4
92,"I have a septo-rhinoplasty scheduled in a few months. I went to the doctor recently, to assess if I truly needed a septoplasty, and I found out the following information: Because of her nasal valve dysfunction, septoplasty will not correct her breathing and I have also recommended nasal valve repair with a left spreader graft. This will reinforce and open the nasal valve. Will a septoplasty surgery address nasal valve collapse? Or is that a completely different procedure?",4
93,"Hello! Last weekend I broke my nose in an ATV accident. The ENT looked at my CT scan and told me I have a fracture of the interior nasal spine, fracture of the septum with impaction of the fracture fragments, and fracture of the nasal bones. Im having difficulty breathing through the right side and my nose has an obvious deformity but they said they want to do the surgery the end of August. What kind of surgery is normally done for this and what kind of operation should I prepare for?",4
95,"Hit in the nose when I was 14. I had surgery to straighten my nose shortly after the incident. When I was 29, I was hit in the nose again, causing deviated septum and hard to breathe out of one nostril. I had my first consultation today with an ENT doctor who has specializations in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. The operations I will be having are as follows: nasal reconstruction with osteotomies, bilateral spreader grafts, septoplasty, and a submucosal resection of turbinates.",4
98,Ive been wanted to get my septum piercing for the longest time and am planning to get one. The only problem is I will be having septoplasty around nov/dec and Im not sure if I would be able to keep it in or take it out beforehand. So should I go ahead and get the piercing now or wait a few months after the surgery and once everything has healed.,4
110,"Since childhood Ive had a few accidents involving nasal trauma. It hadnt bothered me until the last time I injured it during an altercation. Since I've had issues breathing, feeling as though my passageways are blocked and I get facial pain around the upper portion of my nose that leads to headaches. When I rub the sides of my nose together I feel crackling. I don't think it will help but I attached a photo",4
119,"Battling chronic sinus infections for over 20 years. At one point I was getting 8 in one year. For the last 5 years I have been doing daily preventative stuff that stopped them. Now they're not working anymore. This is my 3rd sinus infection in 4 months. While breathing properly was always a struggle due to deviated septum, I haven't been able to breathe out my left nostril for years now. Also, I wake up every morning with a pounding headache. Seeing GP again today. Should I see a ENT? Surgery?",4
121,"Compared to other surgeries, I have heard lots of nightmares about this;&nbsp;going blind, a fatter nose, nerve damage, nose running and bleeding, nasal obstruction not cured. It's sad because I've had trouble breathing for a long time but I've had to avoid the surgery because the risk complication seems too high. What makes this surgery so difficult? My ENT said that once septal cartilage is displaced, it's extremely difficult to get back in position.",4
125,I have had trouble breathing out of my nose for a while now. I have tried saline and other measures believing it was congestion. I have had minimal improvement with these measures. I am finally going to see an ENT doctor to see if I can find out the culprit.,4
126,"I have a deformed, big nose and I intend to have surgery on. However on initial consultations with local doctors, I've been told the deviation cannot be fully fixed. I'd like to know your opinion about the result shape of my nose, and how a doctor may go about recovering the deviation that may be successful or not.",4
128,Finally ended up with a septoplasty after 3 years of not being able to breath through nose and muffled ears. Dr. Kept saying it was clear now to just wait for swelling to go down. 1year now and I STILL cant breath through my nose and ears muffled because of it. How&nbsp;do I open up my nasal airways to fix this? I am overly stressed and getting depressed from it now too. I need some kind of answer/remedy.,4
130,"I have had frequent nosebleeds since childhood, dryness and constant blockage on either side. My question is: Can a plastic surgeon diagnose my nasal condition(polyps, valve collapse, turbinates, deviated septum) during a consultation in his office or do I have to go to an ENT and then bring a letter with the result to the plastic surgeon?",4
135,"I'm in pain but I am scared to tell my doctor the truth. I had an ENT suggest a septoplasty to help my breathing. I've almost gone through with it twice but I am extremely worried about the procedure failing and ending up with collapse but my nose hurts and I can't breathe well so I'd like it done. In college, I dabbled with cocaine but it was mostly spread out not daily. I never plan to do it again. He's never asked if I did cocaine after examining me. Will telling my doctor I used it result in insurance not covering it? Is the procedure safe for me?",4
136,"I went to an ent/plastic surgeon because I have been having pressure on my ears, dry mouth when I wake up, when I do cardio I dont feel I have enough air. trained myself to breath though the nose. Doctor says my issues are caused by my deviated septum. Do I really need surgery?",4
143,"- Looking to see if there are alternate ways to fix this issue, other than surgery? - Do you guys see this as a complex case? - Symptoms including breathing and bleeding issues - I also have been recently diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and wondering can it effect/complicate surgery?",4
147,"I'm a 35 year old woman with a deviating nose. I have tried to seek help and advice from my doctor but I did not receive helpful information, besides use nasal spray and anti histamine for my constant runny nose. Does it look like I have enlarged turbinate And/or deviated septum?. I really hope to get this corrected, it is affecting my daily life.",4
160,"Used to have a normal nose, now very asymmetrical (no rhinoplasty done).&nbsp;I do not remember experiencing any nose trauma but I started noticing my asymmetry issues about a decade ago (older pictures of me show a perfectly normal nose) & it seems to get worse with time. I did have a deviated septum & had a septoplasty/turbinate reduction in Feb 2019 & was hoping it would help my asymmetry but it didn't at all & seemed to cause some saddle nose I didn't have before.&nbsp;",4
162,"I have internal nasal and can clearly see the point where my nostrils collapse inward when I breath. The opening on the inside if my nose is very narrow and when I spread it open, I can breath really well. I feel I would be a good candidate for flaring sutures considering it can be done under local Anesthesia and Ive had a septoplasty, turbinate reduction and latera implants (fixed my external nasal collapse) Are flaring sutures a speciality most ENTs know or would I have to go with a specialist.? Thanks",4
163,My second septoplasty and second turbinate reduction were in March. My second surgeon doesn't think it's empty nose syndrome or a collapsed valve and says my septum isn't the problem. He recommended a balloon sinuplasty. There is a noticeable bulge on the right side of my nose. I'm highly allergic to dust but my insurance doesn't cover immunotherapy for it. Allergy medication is also ineffective. What are my options?,4
168,I have a follow-up question to a previous post. My normal weight is around 200-210. Unfortunately I have gained to about 240lbs. I want to get both these procedures done but I was told by someone/not a physician that I probably should lose the weight first.. I am in the process of getting ready to go on the road for I don't know how long a year possibly more and just travel. I am just not sure I can lose all that weight that soon. Should I lose the weight or would it really matter that much?,4
170,I have a nose allergy and dont know when I can use my spray after having a septoplasty,4
172,I have major pain at times in the hump on my nose from a injury as a child. Im 21 now. I have been to an ENT specialist and they said I have a deviated septum and told em to use Flonase. That was a big fail and did nothing. I have constant pain on the bump in my nose and mainly breathe thru my mouth because I cant breath that good thru my nose.,4
177,i have a deviated septum and i have enlarged turbinates. I have to use nasal spray every day. I had my turbinates reduced about 10 years ago as an out patient it was very uncomfortable and painful my ENT did it. How bad does a deviated septum have to be to need surgery. I have been told I should have it fixed and that its not that bad.. so I don't really know and can the turbinates be fixed at the same time,4
183,"I have been doing saline rinses and using Nasacort but neither has benefited my breathing. I am unable to breathe properly through both nostrils when lying down, sitting, standing, and walking. I do get some airflow through both nostrils, however only when doing strenuous exercise such as lifting weights or running. Sometimes the nostrils switch in allowing air to pass, however there seems to be a trend in the left nostril being blocked the majority of the time. Inferior turbinates look swollen.",4
184,"I had a septoplasty about 4 years ago. For roughly the past year, I have experienced chronic post nasal drip.I have tried every medication (prescription nasal sprays including Ipratropium, Azelastine, Flonase) as well as singulair&nbsp;and several antihistamines. I have tried nasal irrigation with ZERO improvement. What can I do? I am going crazy. Constantly sniffling, and it just doesn't stop. The worst part is, I can't seem to either completely blow it out, or suck it in.",4
199,"2 months post op I have worse breathing than before also believe my nose is wider/still not straight. Extremely disappointed. I get a CT scan and shows that it is still minor deviation. Talked to my surgeon prior said everything is alright, which I do not agree. Do I need a septorhinoplsty this time to thin my nose bridge back to normal and straighten my septum?",4
202,"Septorhinoplasty scheduled in 7 days. Insurance covered due to deviated septum from past accident. Just got ins claim back accepted but includes Turbinate reduction and submucous inferior turbinate. Had pre op and seen this was on the plan for surgery, but went home and researched and I don't want it! I don't want to change the way I feel breathing. Can I request the Septorhino but without the Turbinate? Will the doc let me choose to kick out part of his plan?",4
206,"Can only breathe through one nostril at a time and very poorly, as in I have to open my mouth every once in a while as I can hardly breathe through my nose at all. Should I go see a doctor, will they do surgery?",4
209,"I had a septoplasty & turbinate reduction done 5 months ago. It seemed to help my mouth breathing as i have better flow out of my right side. But no change on my left side. The air flow is greatly reduced and labored. My ENT said the cartilage had reverted, but he could it again, a more aggressively this time. Do i have a better chance of success a 2nd time or more complications? I am 60 & have well-controlled diabetes, but have noted that i take longer to heal. Also have allergies to cats.",4
210,Nasal endoscope had been done for me after 6 weeks of septoplasty in another hospital not by my surgeon.Doctors told me that nasal septum is still deviated in the upper part and the surgery has to be done again for complete relief.But my surgeon repeatedly saying that my nose block is due to allergy and there is no connection with nasal septum. im confused whether to trust my surgeon or endoscope result.Please guide me whether i should undergo a surgery again?Or is there any other option?,4
217,Septoplasty had been done for me before 18 days due to nasal deviation but my nose is still blocked like before.Its worse when i lie down.when will i get complete relief?,4
221,"I believe I have a deviated septum so I'm considering checking it out, and at the same time change up my nose to a smaller size. At the same time I want to learn a martial art out of self defense reasons, I could really care less about competitions, if I'm learning the art its to defend myself and that's it. My question is should I still consider the surgery? I've seen answers that are ok with individuals going into the military after a 2 month period, so is it not ok per this context and why?",4
224,"I recently had a Septorhinoplasty with a turbinate reduction by my (board certified) doctor. Never did I think Id be wondering, post-op, if it were too small and perhaps lacked the amount of structure in the bridge to support it. I dont doubt my doctors capabilities. Im just scared as this is all new to me and am learning that noses that have been operated on can shrink and/or cave in over time. Can this happen to me? Can anyone give me their expert opinion based on my before and after?",4
229,"Good Morning Doctors! I have spider veins/capillaries on my nose after septoplasty. I had a Septoplasty a year ago and I noticed a ton of capillaries popping up soon after this very surgery.

Sinus pain + infections from flare ups monthly. 3 yrs of ineffective shots, pills, sprays. 2017: ENT performed turbinectomy/septoplasty. He says Im wide open looking up nose now & is puzzled when CT shows infection. Can sinus inflammation restrict airflow/breathing? Any thoughts about whats going on?",4

Is this normal? It means my first follow up appointment will be 5 weeks after surgery. My surgery duration was approx 25 minutes, had not stents and absorbable sutures. Packing was removed 4 hours after surgery. And advised to do (homemade) saline washes with salt water and bicarbonate soda.",4
248,"I've been back to the doctor 4 times since my surgery because I'm very congested and have an awful smell. He stopped all nasal rinses and most sinus pills because he thought maybe it was drying my nose out to much and making smell worse. Two days ago, I blew out a very large size piece of mucus. Is this normal to take this long to heal? Swelling, the smell, the congestion? Any suggestions on how to help get rid of the smell faster? It's awful!",4
251,"I did a septoplasty surgery in May 2018 with slight turbinate reduction. Months passed by with little to no noticeable improvement. On Jan 23rd 2019, I did another surgery for strengthening the nostril cartilage, preventing nasal collapse and another slight turbinate reduction. My breathing improved for a few days and then it went back to being congested. There seem to be some sort of inflammation causing this but I don't know what is causing the inflammation. Smoke? Dust? Diet? What should I do now?",4
253,"I had a combined closed rhinoplasty and septoplasty, nearly 3 months ago.

When I breathe, the air feels very cold and dry (even inside a warm room) and immediately I feel air on my throat and to my lungs (cold,dry). Ive been doing rinses, using humidifier and keeping nostrils moistened but Im worried that my turbinates are not functioning properly. Also my voice is sounding nasal since the surgery even though it seems the swelling has subsided. Are these symptoms likely to balance out with more time?",4

273,I was looking to get allergy shots and got referred to an ENT who told me I had a deviated septum. My breathing wasn't bad but I thought I should get it fixed. I am now left with a nose that drips when I eat or look down and post nasal drip that dries up in the back of my throat when the weather gets cold that is impossible to get out. I believe the turbinate reduction is the reason air I breath feels so dry and cold and is causing my throat to close when doing outdoor activities. Please help.,4
275,"I had rhinoplasty, tip plasty, and alar reduction when I was in Korea a few years ago and I realized that I may have a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates.

I can't stand it, so I have been picking the dried blood and crusts out of my nose (often attached to nasal hair - so it hurts). Is this bad to do? If so, why? What can I do instead?

	Went in for septoplasty surgery to take care of difficulty breathing through my right nostril in October. Now December I am still having difficulty breathing through that nostril. When I had my last appointment with my ENT doctor a month ago and asked about the breathing he said no further surgery could be performed, that internal swelling could last a few months after the operation and that that could be partly the reason for the blockage. If it&#39;s not the swelling, can I do anything else?

	Hi, I recently had a septoplasty, turbinectomy and rhinoplasty one month ago. This was because I couldn't breath at night. I'm doing the nasal irrigation flushes everyday as recommended. After the surgery until now which is 3 weeks post op, I find that I sneeze a few times a day which never used to happen. I have moderate eye bags though my eyes do not water.

319,"I have turbinate hypertrophy. The CT scan showed that I neither have a sinus infection nor a deviated septum. It isn't caused by allergies either since I don't have any symptoms that are usually caused by allergies like: Sneezing, runny nose, Itchy, red or watery eyes, etc. - expect nasal congestion.

919,I've had 2 septoplasties but my septum is still severely deviated so I was wondering if I could do a third surgery. Is this safe?,4
920,Now i have attempted to let it heal. And it does scab. But breathing too hard or sneezing to hard just shoots the scab right out. Also if those dont happen after a couple days the scab is large to to point it makes breathing the nose very difficult and after some frustration. I eventually break the scab so i can breath through my nose.,4

The goretex implant is thin (1 mm) and it seems that little would change without it. The original surgeon offered to remove it, but I don't trust him (he put it without telling me anything). Do you think he is uniquely equipped to remove it because he knows where he put it and the position or can I safely go to another surgeon for the removal? I found another surgeon I like",4

Can it be repaired? Thank you!",4
973,ENT is on holiday vacation. I read on here that a septoplasty and turbinate reduction does not change appearance. I found a study that does say it can. I really like slight lift that I only needed 1 side (side that was pushed over). Do stints push up your nose like that and make it appear less? The anesthesia staff praised him for his plastic surgery abilities. I do know he didn't break any bone.,4
977,Was getting better until yesterday. Have been using saline nasal spray every 2-3 hours. Keeping my nose clean and crust free. Was told not to blow my nose. Unrelieved severe congestion making it hard to breathe started last night. Nothing helped. I feel like I have a sinus infection now. Sinuses burn coughing up yellow mucous which was previously clear or bloody. Did blow two large clots from right nostril but still congested on the left. What else can I do?,4

988,I am due to get a Septoplasty next week. I've been told it will make me feel extremely sick for a week after. Is this true? Or is it the anesthetic? I am very nervous about the operation and would like to know what to be ready for.,4
1001,I am worried for the recovery of my nose. I was prescribed a nasal spray following my septoplasty and on the instructions it directed to use the spray and blow my nose.

As of now though, I'm terrified that I've broken it!!!! I have a followup with my doctor tomorrow so I'm trying to make no movements and rest with my head up on a pillow until then.",4
1229,"I wanted to know, does the septal cartilage that is left in your nose after septoplasty continue to grow and over a very long time perhaps 20 or so years eventually fill in in the gap left behind by surgery. It has to right? I mean I understand what happens histologically to the tissue, is that the border becomes necrotic and is eaten by macrophages and then elongated fibers seal off the viable cartilage but that cartilage continues to grow and break through that fiber barrier.",4
1231,I had my septoplasty turbinate reduction surgery one month ago and I have cleaned out my nose as instructed. My concern is that there is large black/green looking things stuck on the walls of the inside of my nose and I can't get them out no matter how much I use neilmed nasal rinse or my saline spray. I'm concerned because I don't want it to cause any type of infection with it being there. They look like large boogers but they just don't come out and it's blocking my air way. What can I do?,4
1235,"My doctor said I could blow my nose as long as I don't contort the shape, and I have been very careful not to touch the sides of my nose when I blow it, but after temporarily misplacing my post op brochure I checked online for do's and don'ts and a lot of doctors seem to be saying not to blow your nose. I already did. Will it mess up the shape of my septum?",4

To make it worse I also get bad ear infections due to the mucus build up. I have seen my ENT doctor and he had several X-rays of my deviated septum which led him to advise that I should surgically get this fixed.

1294,Like grafts are sutured and put into a pocket... what keeps the septum from not being loose. During a septoplasty you remove a lot of septum and usually leave an L strut of about 1cm... but how does that be kept in place. Does it rely on suture for the rest of your life or after surgery it heals back to the surrounding tissues like before surgery. Just a very curious person thanks!,4

1299,"I looked into septoplasty and I was a little confused on the whole procedure. I read that some pieces of the septum are removed, but doesnt that mean there is now gaps in your nose. if your septum is a unit and you take some parts away from the unit you have missing links so how does that work. Also you stitch it back in.. are those usually temporary sutures to help it settle correctly or are they permanent and if so why thanks!",4
1301,"My main problem that I have trouble finding information on, is the vast amount of mucus produced because of it.

1525,I had a septoplasty and 50% inferior turbinate reduction 4 months ago but i am finding breathing still difficult.Left nostril which was the good nostril before surgery now feels 50 to 75% blocked most times.I need to work harder than normal to breathe through the nose all the time.At times nose feels dry and inflamed posteriorly and a cool mist humidifier does help to an extent.I dont know if i have empty nose syndrome or the difficulty breathing is due to a 6mm posterior perforation .,4
1527,"My Oral Surgeon diagnosed a severe deviated septum, and has quoted me $8000 to have it fixed. Isn't a Septoplasty covered under MSP in British Columbia? Should I see my family doctor and get a referral for an ENT specialist to get a more detailed diagnosis? Or should I go for a consultation with a Cosmetic/Plastic Surgeon? How can I have this covered under MSP? Thanks.",4
1530,"i have been having alot of issues with breathing through my nose i can't eat without being able to close my mouth i have problems sleeping with my nouth close basically i have to have my mouth open to be able to breathe comfortably and i have been having issues with having to take deep breaths to be able to feel like im breathing good. I have had my nose broken and sprained more then once as i grew up, now it feels like my problems are getting worse. Is there anyway possible i can get help?",4
1533,"Is there anything I can do or do I have to wait a full year to really know if it's going to improve. I never had it block before it, was only restricted.",4
1538,"No left nasal wall (carelessly removed), no left turbinate or valve cartilage. Right side - collapsed nasal wall, some removed cartilage and the cartilage from a valve repair.

Six years of this and cannot waste anymore of my life! This is so terrible and please do not ignore this question/situation/scenario.",4

1550,"On the day of my procedure, my surgeon seemed hurried. He briefly spoke to me (maybe 3 sentences) to explain what he would do but didn't say anything about the crookedness which we'd previously discussed at length. When I reminded him, he asked me to look straight at him as if he was examining me for the first time and then murmured that it would be a challenge. Postop, I don't see any signs of improvement or of the osteotomies he planned. Can I independently confirm whats been done? Thanks!",4
1552,I had a septoplasty 2 weeks ago and was advised not to touch my nose. Since then my nose has become literally covered in gunk. Am I able to gently scrub my nose with a rough washcloth?,4
1555,During surgery the doctor found the septum completely curled in U shape obstructing both nostrils. Experiencing difficult breathing went back to see why. Surgeon is now telling him the septum has a memory and is returning to its pre surgery position. Odd. Now proposing a second surgery. Dr. packed the nose with sponge and come back in a week and we can decide. Do we need a second opinion? Thank you,4
1558,"Before 2 years I have septoplasty and now I found with the help of other doctors that it failed.now iam suffering with allergy, sinus and a DNS can a sinuswash solve my problem, if cant what must I do to solve my problems please help me.",4
1559,I believe it is from scarring. The surgery was 9 months ago. I never and repeat never had sleep apnea and I am not overweight and rather thin and in excellent physical shape. The roof of my mouth and my septum now vibrate when I sleep. What can I do?,4
1560,"My boyfriend had surgery to correct his deviated septum. It's been about 6 months since surgery and his snoring is very slightly lessened. His breathing is much better but he still has a very loud snore. Are there any products that can help this? We were thinking about doing an anti snore chin strap, but are afraid of the potential negatives that can have. We've tried Neti pots, he uses Flounase every day, and we've tried other basic solutions. Please help!",4
1561,"
	I got my stents and cast removed yesterday being day 6 post-op. The ENT Dr. had me blow my nose once removed. But today I blew it a few times with a bit of pain and then I read the forums stating you're not suppose to. Now I'm worried. I just assumed you can because he had me to do it yesterday. How do I know if I caused any damage?

1564,I had septoplasty done on my nose on the 17th of july and once all my scabs and everything clear i found stitches literally hanging out of my nose. I just shived them back into my nose the first couple of time but now im scared if they are meant to dissolve how can they when they just hang in my nose? I also tried pulling on them to see if they just fall out but it hurts as they are obviously attached. What do i do?,4
1566,I am getting septoplasty surgery soon (breathing related). Doctor I am visiting is an ENT. I visited twice before setting up the appointment. He did not even look in the inside of my noise. All he did is look at the outside and said you have a thin nose and hump. He told me he will remove the hump and widen the noise so I can breath better. He spend less than a minute with me both times. I am afraid to get the surgery with him because I don't know if he is good enough. What should I do?,4

I&#39;m also emetophobic as well and general anesthesia frightens me since I&#39;ve had past surgeries and thrown up for about 2 days after. Can I get this done with local anesthesia? I really hope so because I don&#39;t think I will ever get this fixed if anyone won&#39;t do it that way.

1597,"The surgery was relatively routine. No bones were broken, just straightened the deviated septum. The healing is looking good. I'm able to breathe great and no bloody discharge has come out. I finished my antibiotics and now I am just on nasal saline drops. I feel like I am able to go to the beach because I feel great but I just wanted clarification if it's safe. In addition, I am NOT going to swim, I just want to relax and enjoy a day off of work.",4

1607,"A year ago, I underwent a turbinate reduction/septoplasty. After a few months, I started experiencing a new sort of chronic nasal congestion that seemed to depend on my adrenaline levels. When I exercise or am in a stressful situation (i.e. a job interview), my symptoms subside right away, but come back after I'm done. My ENT isn't sure why, but suggested that the surgery may have compromised blood flow in my turbinates (i.e. a variation of venous stasis). Is this a feasible explanation?",4
1616,"I have had recurring sinus infections, congestion, minor nose bleeds, and phlegm problems for several years. I tried 2 nasal sprays, Flonase and Nasonex. Neither spray seemed to help and had negative side effects. I have success taking pseudoephedrine for a short time and have also tried saline rinses, but nothing helps for very long. My ENT suggests a septoplasty and tubinate reduction surgery. I'm concerned that this could make some of my symptoms (mainly the phlegm) worse instead of better.",4
1621,I have no any problems in my nose ..but in saudi arab on 14/6/2015 one Dr told me you have infection near your operation location in your nose and give me tab: Augmentin 1 g twice for 7 days and now i continue.

He said I shouldn't be worried, and that wouldn't affect anything. I asked if the deviation could get worst. He said... I have to say, I became even more paranoic. Is the doctor right? Is this small redeviation more normal, and after two weeks will not get worst??",4

The doctor said no limitations any more in my post-op about one week ago, but I'm worried that roller coasters might be an issue and he just did not mention that either because it was expected or because it's something that's not a common, everyday task like lifting objects or exercising.",4
1635,"As you can see from the attached images there is not a big deviation, but i still experience breathing problems and sometimes i have a terrible headaches. I have read somewhere that there is balloon surgery available nowadays, but i dont know if that can help me to avoid the painful and risk-taking surgery. Your opinions are more than welcomed. Thanks.",4

I was sick at one point and nearly died because I couldn't breathe through my mouth due to the sickness and my nose doesn't work. I looked closely and can see my septum sticks out to the side that I have the hardest time with. Is there a surgery to make it symmetrical without drastically changing my nose? How much would it cost?",4

Breathing is getting worse even with the medication. Having a panic attack trying to breath. Called the hospital to book an appointment for earlier date but none was available. What should i do?

Im assuming all of this is due to the untreated trauma? I have had difficulty with breathing and have difficulty smelling. Lately I have had random headaches and ears always feel plugged like i just got off a plane. Will i need more than a septoplasty to fix these problems and deformity? I have a pending auth to see an ENT.,4

1672,I had Sinus/ Septoplasty/ Turbinates/ and Rhino surgery 5 1/2 weeks ago. I saw my surgeon yesterday and he confirmed that my septum is starting to move but could also move back again. ( from deviated to not deviated). Pre surgery I was 80% blocked. Now I'm 40% blocked. What are the chances it could move back to correct itself once rather than move back to its memory? Also if I do need a revision what are the chances it would move again to its stubborn deviated self? It took him 15 times to get it straight,4
1682,I've had septoplasty in January and until now I've not felt the full relief of the surgery. My nose is always stuffed either side and shifts. Post-op my surgeon asked me to use nasal spray to irrigate my nose every day and every night. 1 month and a half later he asked me to start using Nasonex twice a day for 2 weeks. I still do not feel a relief. My voice sounds as if I have a permanent flu. Any suggestions as to what I can do? I'm away from my home country so I can't see my surgeon.,4

He explained that this type of surgery is very hard to get right the first time -- what?! He wants to cut through my forehead to reduce the graft in 6 weeks.

2089," I just had a septoplasty &amp; turbinectomy. My surgeon told me to remove the packaging by myself on Sunday. It consists of 2 fingers of a latex glove that are filled with bandage. It is really crusted with blood &amp; even changing my moustache bandage hurts like nuts because it pushes against the rubber. He also said I was not to flush my nose with saline or use a neti pot for 3 whole weeks but, looking online at reliable sources I see that not rinsing is the best way to ruin your surgery. Any advice?",4
2090, I had septoplasty and turbinate reduction about 3 months ago. I still try to use saline or a qtip /w hydrogen peroxide to clean my nose instead of picking. Today I was unable to remove some dried mucous doing this so I tried picking it. it resulted in a little bit of bleeding. Not enough for the blood to trickle out of my nose but I did see blood on the qtip when I went to finish cleaning. Could picking nose 3 mo after septoplasty cause septum to deviate again or possibly cause septal hemotoma?,4

	I had septoplasty a week ago and while I appear to be healing fine, the nasal congestion at night is unbearable. I can only get a few hours sleep as I wake up every 10-15 minutes with a very dry mouth. I've been using Rhinaris (a sesame oil atomizer) to lubricate my nose 3-5x a day. My ENT is on vacation this week and I feel like I'm slowly going crazy as this has been happening every night since the procedure. Any suggestions?

	Hi, I've snored for as long as i can remember and do find it difficult breathing through my nose particularly with exercise. I had to quit running as it was near impossible to breathe through my nose so ended up with a dry mouth from only being able to breathe from my mouth. I have to take antihistamines every day and do suffer from post nasal drip also; is my nose being long, over projected and narrow the cause of all my issues? Will i need my nose widened??

	A little background. At 12 I had Bell's Palsy and from athletics through my adolescence I had a nose trama (not certain if it was ever broken). In 2009 after discussing my crooked nose with a plastic surgeon, he recommended septoplasty and that May, I had the surgery. As the years pass, I feel like my nose droops further to the left. I have become so self-conscious about it and want to explore what options (fillers,surgery) I may have before choosing a different plastic surgeon. Thank you!

	16 wks post-op (septoplasty, osteotomy, graft). I know complete results are not achieved for up to 1 yr. But, my left nostril is still very swollen at the base.

	i've experienced severe pain and pressure at back of my nose, usually when crusts come off my septum, since i was headbutted years ago. I saw an ENT who recommended septplasty which i had 3 months ago. first 2 months felt good but i caught a cold and have the same pain / pressure again with brown discharge on the one sidee. Im concerned the septoplasty did not help and maybe i have sinus disease - see photo? Or am i just being impatient and this inflammation i've always had will go with time

	I recently had a septoplasty/turbinectomy and was given cream to put in my nose 3 times a day. The cream hardened in one nostril and I can't get it out; after showing my doctor today when he pulled out the splints, he said it would eventually come out. What's the best way to soften it and get it out easily? I've tried dabbing hot water, steaming it out and doing a saline rinse. The packaging says it's primarily conjunctivitis cream.

	I had a septoplasty and turbinoplasty back in January. My breathing has not improved at all. To be honest it feels worse. I have gone to my Dr. many times since the surgery and he is saying that it looks clear. I can only breathe out of one nostril at a time and the one I can breathe out of feels clogged all the time. I dont know what to do or what is causing it. he has tried me on all types of medicine and took bllod work for allergy test. Nothing came back. Any suggestions?

	When the splints came out, I had about an hour of the best breathing I have enjoyed since I was a child. Shortly after, the nasal passages closed considerably and were worse than prior to the operation. Since then, I have enjoyed a slow recovery but have reached a plateau. I have some decent days and others that are similar to pre-op. My nasal passages FEEL swollen and sensitive. (worse during exercise). My surgeon has said the nasal passages look fine. Nasonex (steroid) spray does not help much

Since then i suffer frequently from sinusitis and most recently am getting pain in my right nostril just at the entry point. It feels like a bony lump is appearing and is very painful could you shed any light on this?

	I have broken my nose four times. I have trouble breathing, on a good day both nostrils work, but most days only one is functioning. Along with breathing trouble, i get really bad headaches when i wear glasses or go on roller coasters. I saw a doctor and he said i had a deviated septum, and my nose is crooked. I&#39;m only 18 and surgery is pretty scary.

	Saw an ENT at Kaiser in Panorama City for sinus issues, offered to remove the hump and lift the tip of my nose. My insurance covers it. He has over 25 years of experience and has performed thousands. he's unable to show before &amp; after photos of his work. I'd love a talented ENT to sculpt my nose but i have no way of knowing this ENT's artistic abilities. Does anyone know of Dr.Levin? If i cannot acquire enough feedback on his cosmetic abilities I will undergo the septoplasty WITHOUT the rhinoplasty.

	Had procedure. Was told I had a collapse, then that surgeon in hindsight should have shaved more off turbinate, and it's probably a nasal valve issue. Quality of life was better before procedure. No one seems to answer the q's regarding symptoms or issues that imply revision. Should I have gotten a rhino too, or was this just a shoddy job? Please let me know!

2617,I'm getting a septoplasty and my turbines or something like that cautarized. What does my doctor mean when he also says he's going to &quot;shave down the sides of my upper nose cartilage?&quot; Is that going to think it out up there or get rid of the bump or what?,4
2619,"Injured 10 days ago. Knee to face in Judo class. xray shows possibly 3 breaks. 2 visible on nose and possibly on lower portion of left orbit. He refuses to see a specialist, now complaining of constant severe headaches and feeling of &quot;leaky&quot; air when he exhales out of nose. R the headaches related to sinus, possible orbital fracture or something else? I am worried and can't convince him to see doc. Says people break noses all the time and do nothing to correct. It bled for 3 hours after injury, when I told him about septal hematoma &amp; poss. complications he went for xray.",4
2624,"I had a miscarriage around 8 weeks ago and we are going to try to get pregnant again, but I need to have a deviated septum fixed.  I really don't want to wait to get pregnant, but is it going to affect my pregnancy to have to keep dealing with sinus infections?",4
